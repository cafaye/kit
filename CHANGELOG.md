# Changelog

All notable changes to `kit` are recorded here. kit has no releases yet and no
semver contract — it is consumed by *calling* `workflows/ci.reusable.yml@master`
and by *copying* files out of `lint/`, `docker/`, and `templates/`.

## Unreleased

### Added

- **The observability stack** (PLAN.md §7b). Observability is ON BY DEFAULT and
  worked on in dev: `bin/dev up` brings up the OTel collector and the four LGTM
  backing services, and a service with nothing configured exports into them
  because `<SERVICE>_OTEL_ENDPOINT` *defaults* to the collector that ships with
  the stack. `<SERVICE>_OTEL_ENDPOINT` is the only contract (core D16); the
  shipped collector is just its default value, and unsetting it is a genuine
  no-op implemented with `OTEL_SDK_DISABLED`.
  - `templates/compose/otel-collector.yml` — OTLP **and** container-stderr
    receivers, the redaction allowlist **derived from core's schemas**, the
    `spanmetrics` connector, and fan-out to Tempo/Loki/Mimir. Every endpoint is
    a `${env:...}`; the gate fails on a literal.
  - `templates/compose/{tempo,loki,mimir}/` and
    `templates/compose/grafana/provisioning/` — vendor **configuration** and
    Grafana provisioning as files: three datasources, the dashboard provider, two
    dashboards and three alert rules, all working on first load.
  - `templates/compose/docker-compose.yml` — the four backing services, pinned
    to exact tags, healthchecked, memory-bounded, in an `observability` profile.
    **Grafana, Loki, Tempo and Mimir are AGPL-3.0 and ship UNMODIFIED**;
    `tests/validate.sh` fails on a `build:` stanza on any of them.
  - `templates/compose/.env.example` — every `${KIT_*}` the stack reads, with
    the port block documented.
  - `tests/canary_test.sh` — plants a canary in ten shapes a leak could take
    against a real collector and asserts it reaches no exporter, **and** that the
    allowed data survived.
  - `tests/no_telemetry_in_readiness.sh` — proves a service starts, serves and
    reports healthy with the collector killed, and that a collector whose three
    backends all refuse connections stays healthy, does not restart and does not
    enter a retry loop.
  - The six `templates/otel/<lang>/*.snippet` files now honour
    `<SERVICE>_OTEL_ENDPOINT`, default to the shipped collector, implement the
    free no-op with `OTEL_SDK_DISABLED`, record `error.type` and never
    `error.message`, and emit **exception log records** rather than the
    deprecated `exception` span event.
  - `templates/AGENTS.md` — an Observability section, so the endpoint contract
    and "telemetry is never in a readiness path" reach the service repo where a
    probe would actually be written.

### Changed

- **The port block.** Every published host port moved into **15000-15999**,
  one hundred per service: 15000 Grafana, 15500 Postgres, 15600 NATS client,
  15700 NATS monitoring, 15800 Redis, 15900 Tempo, 15901 Loki, 15902 Mimir. Not
  5432/4222/6379, which are the two or three most likely things already
  listening on a developer's machine — and `bin/dev` is the first command a new
  person runs. The gate asserts membership of the block and no reuse, as a RANGE
  rather than a list, so adding a service does not mean editing a check.
- **`templates/compose/otel-collector.yml` no longer ships `debug` only.** It
  fans out to three backends now, so the privacy boundary is restated as what it
  can actually be: every endpoint a `${env:}`, the exporter set exactly those
  three plus the local `debug`, and a `redaction/*` processor in every pipeline
  before `batch` and therefore before every exporter.
- `templates/bin/dev.sh` — `STACK_TIMEOUT` 120s → 180s (five more containers,
  four with a real initialisation), brings up the `observability` profile by
  default, prints the wall-clock, and prints the observability URLs. The
  escape hatch is `KIT_DEV_PROFILES=`.
- `templates/compose/docker-compose.yml` — the collector's healthcheck probes
  its real `health_check` endpoint instead of printing its component list, and
  the four stores' healthcheck budgets were raised after measuring them.
- `tests/validate.sh` gained an `observability` phase and a `--no-observability`
  flag; both docker-requiring proofs SKIP loudly when docker is absent.

### Added

- `workflows/ci.reusable.yml` — a `bun` job: `bun install --frozen-lockfile` →
  `bun run typecheck` → `bun test`, with an opt-in coverage step. Exists because
  `guard` was hand-rolling a whole workflow for want of one; a repo that adopts
  it can collapse that file to a `uses:` call.
- `workflows/ci.reusable.yml` — an opt-in `telemetry` input (string, default
  `'false'`) and a `telemetry` job that runs the W3C traceparent conformance
  suite for all six languages in a matrix. Opt-in so that adopting kit never
  turns a green repo red.
- `docker/Dockerfile.bun` and `templates/bin-prime/bun.sh` — the other two
  artifacts a language ships, so `bun` is a first-class `language` value.
- `templates/bin/dev.sh` — the local developer loop. `up --wait`, migrate, seed
  an admin, print the URLs. Idempotent; fails loudly and stops *before*
  migrating rather than half-starting.
- `templates/compose/otel-collector.yml` — receiver, batch processor, and a
  `debug` exporter that writes to the collector's own stdout. Sends nothing
  anywhere, by default and by gate. **Superseded by kit-03** below: the
  collector now fans out to Tempo, Loki and Mimir, because observability is on
  by default. The `debug` exporter and the "no literal endpoint" rule stay.
- `templates/otel/<lang>/` — per language: a stdlib `traceparent.*` codec, an
  executed conformance suite, an SDK wiring snippet with a documented
  "when to use which" README, and a statement of the W3C sections implemented.
- `templates/otel/pins.md` — the OTel versions the snippets reference, at the
  otel root because it covers all six languages. kit vendors nothing.
- `README.md` — sections for the local stack and for trace propagation,
  including a worked example of a service adopting propagation, and an accurate
  description of what the gate actually does.

### Fixed

- **The local compose stack could not start.** `otel-collector.yml` resolves its
  values from the collector's own process environment, and Docker Compose does
  not inject the `.env` values it substitutes into containers. Every one resolved
  empty and the collector exited with `processors::memory_limiter: ... must be
  greater than zero`, which names a memory limiter rather than the missing
  environment. The nine `KIT_OTEL_*` values are now passed into the collector
  container. The stack parses, passed every check kit had, and did not work.
- The compose **port check** flagged the collector's in-network bind addresses
  (`0.0.0.0:4317`) as hardcoded published ports. It now reads the parsed
  `ports:` lists, so it can tell a published port from a bind address, and its
  failure message names the service and the value.
- The elixir conformance suite failed 2/13 on two tests that called
  `.outbound_headers` as map access on a struct with no such field, where the
  rest of the file uses the local `outbound/1` helper.
- The elixir "new identifiers are random" test rebound its `seen` set inside a
  `for` comprehension, shadowing the outer binding. The uniqueness assertion
  compared 256 draws against an empty set and could never fail.

### Changed

- `self_test.sh` grew from 5 breakages to 11. Six are new: one semantic
  mutation per language implementation, each against a different W3C section, so
  **every** suite is proven able to fail rather than assumed to. A mutant that
  fails to compile is its own verdict rather than a pass, a missing toolchain is
  a skip that fails the run, and an unmatched mutation is a hard failure so the
  proof cannot rot into proving nothing.
- `validate.sh` reads the CI workflow's `language` options and requires a
  Dockerfile, a `bin/prime` and a `[tools]` pin for each — "half a language is
  worse than none", enforced rather than trusted. It also requires `language`
  options and the job set to be the same list, a ref on every `uses:`, no
  branch refs, and every `${{` to close.
- New checks: the otel-collector environment wiring, that every `*.snippet`
  carries an install line and a pinned version, that every snippet **parses in
  its own language**, and that the README's documented callers only pass inputs
  the workflow actually declares.
- The `telemetry` CI job is a matrix while the seven language jobs stay one-per-
  language: a matrix is right for six stdlib test suites that share nothing, and
  wrong for six toolchains that install different things.
- The `telemetry` input is a string rather than a boolean, because GitHub
  coerces the bare word `false` in some positions and `if: inputs.telemetry` is
  a trap as a result.

### Earlier (kit-01)

- `README.md` — what kit is, how a service repo adopts it, adoption checklist.
- `AGENTS.md` — conventions for this repo.
- `workflows/ci.reusable.yml` — reusable GitHub Actions workflow. Inputs
  `language` (go|ruby|elixir|python|node|rust), `working-dir`, `versions`, and
  `coverage-fail-under`; one job per language, each install → lint → test →
  coverage. No job builds or pushes an image.
- `lint/` — `yamllint.yml`, `golangci.yml`, `rubocop.yml`, `eslint.config.mjs`,
  each with its strictness decisions written down.
- `docker/Dockerfile.{go,rust}` — multi-stage, distroless final.
  `docker/Dockerfile.{ruby,elixir,python,node}` — multi-stage, `*-slim` final.
  All non-root, none on `:latest`, all versioned through build args.
- `templates/bin-prime/{go,ruby,elixir,python,node,rust}.sh` — worktree
  primers; exit 0 only when the tree is genuinely ready.
- `templates/mise.toml` — per-language tool sections with placeholder versions.
- `templates/AGENTS.md` — skeleton repo-conventions file.
- `tests/validate.sh` + `tests/requirements.txt` — the gate, and its deps.
