# Changelog

All notable changes to `kit` are recorded here. kit has no releases yet and no
semver contract — it is consumed by *calling* `workflows/ci.reusable.yml@master`
and by *copying* files out of `lint/`, `docker/`, and `templates/`.

## Unreleased

### Added

- `README.md` — what kit is, how a service repo adopts it, adoption checklist.
- `AGENTS.md` — conventions for this repo.
- `workflows/ci.reusable.yml` — reusable GitHub Actions workflow. Inputs
  `language` (go|ruby|elixir|python|node|rust), `working-dir`, `versions`, and
  `coverage-fail-under`; one job per language, each install → lint → test →
  coverage. No job builds or pushes an image.
- `lint/` — `yamllint.yml`, `golangci.yml`, `rubocop.yml`, `eslint.config.mjs`,
  each with its strictness decisions written down.
- `docker/Dockerfile.{go,rust}` — multi-stage, distroless final.
  `docker/Dockerfile.{ruby,elixir,python,node}` — multi-stage, `*-slim` final.
  All non-root, none on `:latest`, all versioned through build args.
- `templates/bin-prime/{go,ruby,elixir,python,node,rust}.sh` — worktree
  primers; exit 0 only when the tree is genuinely ready.
- `templates/mise.toml` — per-language tool sections with placeholder versions.
- `templates/AGENTS.md` — skeleton repo-conventions file.
- `tests/validate.sh` + `tests/requirements.txt` — the gate, and its deps.
