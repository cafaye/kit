# Changelog

All notable changes to `kit` are recorded here. kit has no releases yet and no
semver contract — it is consumed by *calling*
`.github/workflows/ci.reusable.yml@master` and by *copying* files out of
`docker/` and `templates/`. `lint/` is the exception and no longer belongs to
that sentence: the reusable workflow reads it at run time, so a service inherits
it without a copy (see kit-12 below).

> Entries under **Earlier**, and the three `workflows/ci.reusable.yml` bullets
> below, record the path the file had *at the time*. It was
> `workflows/ci.reusable.yml` until the move recorded in Unreleased/Changed.

## Unreleased

### Added — the account boundary's own advisor: the database grades its own policies

- **`templates/database/tenancy/advisor.sql`.** Eight row-level-security rules as
  one SQL function, `cafaye.advisor_findings(p_schemas text[])`, answering with
  one row per finding in the shape `(name, level, facing, categories,
  description, detail, remediation, metadata, cache_key)`. The **database** is the
  layer that can see what a migration-as-text and a set of denials cannot: a
  policy whose predicate is `true` satisfies every assertion in `isolation.sql`,
  because a permissive predicate RETURNS ROWS and a denial cannot tell
  permitted-by-predicate from permitted-by-accident; and two permissive policies on
  one (table, role, command) combine with **OR**, which no file scanner reads.
  The rules are ported from the shape of Supabase's database advisor and are
  **written from scratch against this fleet's catalogs** — nothing is vendored,
  per that project's own MIT-licensed-advisor rule and this repository's
  no-copy-from-`moon/refs/` rule. Every substitution is stated at the point it
  happens: `anon`/`authenticated` → any non-owner LOGIN role (so the
  source's anonymous-vs-signed-in distinction collapses and two rules become
  four-word rules rather than four), `pgrst.db_schemas` → the `p_schemas`
  argument, `auth.uid()` → `cafaye.current_account_id()`,
  `pg_policies` → `pg_policy` + `pg_get_expr()` (the source reads a materialized
  view their platform refreshes), `facing = EXTERNAL` dropped, and the
  documentation-URL `remediation` replaced by the SQL that fixes the finding.
- **`rls_references_user_metadata` gained a CATALOG half.** The source rule is that
  `auth.users.user_metadata` is user-editable, and the source *admits* it cannot
  do better than a string match. Postgres records a policy's dependencies, so
  "does this predicate read a table a login role may `INSERT` or `UPDATE`" is a
  question about `pg_depend`: a service keeping a `profile_flags` table and writing
  `using (exists (select 1 from profile_flags f where f.is_admin))` has built its
  own `user_metadata` and the keyword half can never find it. The keyword half is
  kept, caveat intact.
- **`multiple_permissive_policies` carries an exemption, and the exemption has a
  control.** A credential table holds FIVE policies, so `(api_keys, <owner>,
  SELECT)` holds two permissive ones permanently — that is MD24's mechanism, and
  they combine as `account_id = the session's account OR token_digest = the digest
  presented`. The rule stays at `WARN` and unsoftened; a group is exempt when
  **every** policy in it was written by the substrate, which is an all-of
  condition, so a hand-written sixth is not exempt. `tests/tenancy_test.sh` plants
  one and requires the rule to fire *and name it*.
- **`tests/tenancy_test.sh` runs it, three ways.** Zero `ERROR`/`WARN` against the
  two tables a service's migration writes, over a scope **derived** from the
  policies `protect_table` created; the exemption released by one hand-written
  policy, asserted to clean up after itself; and every rule fired on a fixture
  built to trip it, each naming itself and its table, scoped to the fixture schema
  alone so no rule is satisfied by whichever other rule happened to return a row.
- **Measured on the way in, and it shaped the file.** `pg_get_expr` deparses a
  name unqualified whenever the **reader's** `search_path` resolves it, and
  `"$user"` is a search_path entry: the same substrate policy reads as
  `cafaye.current_account_id()` for role `alpha` and as `current_account_id()` for
  role `cafaye`, whose `"$user"` schema is `cafaye`. Every regexp therefore accepts
  both forms, and says why. Requiring the qualified form alone would make
  `multiple_permissive_policies` report MD24's own policy as hand-written, and
  make `auth_rls_initplan` silently miss a bare call, to exactly the reader least
  likely to know why. `cafaye.credential_tables()` reads the qualified form only
  and returns nothing at all in that second session — a latent substrate issue,
  recorded rather than fixed here, because `substrate.sql` was out of scope.
- `assertions.txt` is **unchanged**: the advisor answers a different question with a
  different row shape, and the manifest names `isolation.sql`'s assertions.
- Gate shape: `tests/validate.sh` (the `.sql` parse-loop arm and the presence
  check) and `tests/artifacts.json` (`database/tenancy/advisor`, optional, with the
  same "optional is not the same as unexamined" argument the substrate makes).

### Fixed — the `--only` conversion on breakage 59, which could not have held

- **`expect_green_check` no longer appends `--only=<the check the recipe names>`,
  and breakage 59 runs the unfiltered gate again.** Its verdict is emitted by
  `report`, not by `check`:

      tests/validate.sh:5474  report PASS "fleet  (adopting repositories clean; …"

  `--only` is applied inside `check`, `check_par`, `report_par` and
  `bounded_check` — the four that spawn work. `report()` has no filter: every
  `PASS`/`FAIL`/`SKIP` it emits is printed and counted unconditionally. So no
  `--only` value could select it, and the gate's own no-match rule turned "the
  filter matched nothing" into `exit 1`, which failed the recipe's **first**
  assertion:

      FAIL self_test: breakage 59: an UNADOPTED service copies the stack —
        green, and named — the gate went RED (exit 1), so the ceiling is not in force
             FAIL: --only='fleet  (adopting repositories clean;' selected NO check
                    out of the suite.
             87 check(s) were excluded.

  Read that failure carefully, because it is the worst direction to be wrong in:
  it **accuses the adoption ceiling of not being in force** and prints a green
  gate's own findings underneath. The ceiling was in force throughout.

- **It was the SEVENTH conversion, and the only one never measured.** The reach
  table in `REPORT-kit-gate-speed-02.md` §4b walked the six `expect_red_check`
  conversions plus a control. `expect_green_check` is a *different helper* with a
  *different single caller*, so the conversion was made and never run. A
  conversion nobody ran is a conversion nobody proved — the same lesson as
  breakage 59's own history in that helper, which was once reported red because
  the harness read the gate through a pipe.

- **Cost, honestly: ~35 s on one recipe out of 94.** The alternative is a filter
  that names nothing, or one naming an unrelated `check` while the verdict under
  assertion is a `report` — a decoration on the command line that proves nothing
  about the thing the recipe is about. That is the weakened gate this suite
  exists to refuse, and it is the same trade already made for `expect_skip_check`
  (23b).

- **Verified both directions on the real recipe, not by reading the code:** with
  the conversion present, breakage 59 fails with the output above and
  `failures=1`; with it reverted, the same recipe on the same fixture prints
  `PASS self_test: breakage 59: … stayed green and named the debt` and
  `failures=0`.

### Changed — `--only` now reaches every recipe it can reach, and two helpers
  prove less than they did

- **`tests/self_test.sh`: breakages 2, 2b, 3, 4, 5 and 6 now run
  `expect_red_check` and append `--only=<the check the recipe names>`** — the
  mechanism that was already in `expect_red_check` and in nothing else. Measured
  on this machine: a full `--static-only` gate run is **42.70 s** and a run
  filtered to one check is **7.88 s**, so each converted recipe saves ~35 s.
  **`expect_green_check` (59) and `expect_skip_check` (23b) were converted by
  this packet too and have since been reverted** — see the Fixed entry above and
  `git show ab25775`. Both name a verdict that is a `report`, and `--only`
  cannot reach a `report`.

- **Six proofs got STRONGER, not just faster.** `expect_red` asserts only "the
  gate went red", which is a weak claim when forty checks can make it red; all
  six now assert `FAIL <the named check>`, and each names the check it is about
  as a variable, so a rename on either side breaks the file loudly.

- **Breakage 1 deliberately still runs the unfiltered gate, and says why.** The
  verdict that catches a deleted `templates/otel/go/traceparent.go` is
  `templates/otel/go/  (4 artifacts present)`, which is a `report`. `--only` is
  applied inside `check`, `check_par`, `bounded_check` and `tier` — the four that
  spawn work — so a `report` is printed on a filtered run and still paid for.
  Measured: that copy under `--only=ZZZ_NO_SUCH_CHECK_XYZ` printed exactly that
  one `FAIL` and nothing else.

- **The two green controls are unfiltered on purpose** (`expect_green`: the
  unbroken tree, and breakage 31b). Their whole claim is that the gate is green
  on a tree it did not break, and a filter would narrow the claim to the named
  check instead of the tree.

### Added — the profile, and what it says

- **`PROFILE-gate.md` — where this gate's time actually goes, measured rather
  than guessed.** `self_test` is **~96%** of a full run (~4,905 s of ~5,103 s
  projected), because each of its 94 breakages is a whole `tests/validate.sh`
  running 113.6 timed checks to learn one fact about one named check. The top
  three costs are **98.2%** of the run; the longest tail row is 1.2 s. The run
  it is from was truncated at 569.0 s and the file says so in its own first
  paragraph.

- **`HANDOFF-kit-gate-speed.md`** — the successor's brief, including the finding
  that decides the order of work: **`--only`, which the recipe comments call
  "the 60×", is appended by `expect_red_check` and by nothing else, so 21 of 94
  recipes still run the whole static phase.** The real factor is ~47×.

### Added — the gate can now say where its own time went

- **`KIT_PROFILE=<file>` writes a timing profile of any gate run.** A gate that
  takes ten minutes cannot be improved from intuition, and every claim about
  which part is slow is a claim about a measurement nobody else can take on the
  same tree — so the measurement is part of the gate rather than something a
  worker hand-assembles with `date` calls and a scratch file. The TSV is four
  tab-separated columns — kind, label, seconds, tag — and every row in it is
  already an answer to some question about the run.

- **One TSV row per timed region, in five kinds that are never summed together.**
  `check` (a serial `check`/`check_verbose`), `cpu` (a `check_par` child — these
  OVERLAP, so their sum is an upper bound on the parallel region, not its
  duration), `tier` (a `bounded_check`), `phase` (the interval between two
  `section` headers, plus a hand-placed marker per top-level phase), `verdict` (a
  loop that reached its verdict from a `[ -x ]` rather than a command) and
  `total`. The phase rows are the safety net: a tier that is a bare `report` over
  a heredoc spawns no command at all, so the per-check rows cannot see it and the
  phase rows can. A profile whose rows add up to more than the run is a profile
  that has been read wrong, which is why `cpu` rows are never summed with the
  rest.

- **Every verdict line is a row, because `report` is where the row is written.**
  Timing the check *helpers* left forty `PASS` lines with no measurement beside
  them — a hole that reads as "cheap" to everyone who reads the table later. The
  arms that reach a verdict without spawning anything are the case that proves
  it, and they are now measured too: `report` closes whatever interval is open
  and re-arms it, so the cost lands on the verdict that ends the work.

- **The self-test's 94 child gates are separable without touching
  `tests/self_test.sh`.** Every recipe runs a whole `tests/validate.sh` in a
  throwaway copy, and those copies inherit `KIT_PROFILE` — so without a boundary
  the most expensive phase in the run would be one undifferentiated mass of rows
  whose labels are the same ones the gate's own rows carry. `kit_total` writes a
  `total` row on the EXIT trap of *every* invocation, and `self_test` runs its
  children in sequence, so the `total` rows ARE the segment boundaries: rows
  between two consecutive `total` rows are one gate invocation. `KIT_PROFILE_TAG`
  is read into the tag column and inherited when set, which lets a caller label
  a child without this file knowing anything about it.

- **Off by default, and off means off.** Every measurement site reads
  `_t0=0; [ -n "$_PROFILE" ] && _t0="$(_pf_now)"`, so with the variable unset the
  clock is never read and no process is spawned — which is a real design
  constraint rather than a nicety, because a profiler that makes the run it
  profiles slower reports its own overhead as the gate's cost. The clock is
  integer milliseconds from `perl -MTime::HiRes` rather than `awk`: an `awk`-per-
  measurement version would have added ~38,000 processes to a run that spawns
  ~19,000 checks, and its numbers would have been wrong in the direction that
  matters. `kit_total` runs on the EXIT trap so the table's denominator is a
  measurement rather than the reader's arithmetic over rows that are
  individually correct and collectively incomplete.

- **The gate's own output is byte-identical with the profiler on and off.**
  Verified, not asserted: `diff` over a full `--static-only` run's stdout and
  stderr, profiled against plain, is empty. Nothing here writes to stdout, and
  `--only` and `tests/self_test.sh` both read that output by position.

- **It is not a gate.** Nothing in the profiler can change a verdict, and a
  profiling run is not a substitute for a plain one — the run that printed the
  table is still the run whose exit status counts.

### Fixed — `bin/dev down` left the observability containers running

- **Measured, and it is the mirror of the `print_urls` fix.** The backends are
  behind a compose profile, and `docker compose down` without that profile does
  not touch them. So `KIT_DEV_PROFILES=observability bin/dev up` followed by a
  plain `bin/dev down` exited 0, printed "stopping the stack (volumes kept)", and
  left tempo, loki and grafana **running and healthy**. A teardown that reports
  success while three containers and their memory limits are still up costs more
  than a printed URL that does not resolve.

- **`down` and `nuke` now stop the whole project.** Both read the project's own
  profile list from `compose config --profiles` and pass every one, so the
  teardown covers what is actually running whichever variable the shell happens
  to have. The list comes from the compose file because a hardcoded
  `observability` would be a second copy of a name that already lives there.

- **`nuke` mattered more.** It removes the volumes the observability containers
  were writing to while leaving those containers running, so Docker recreated
  the volumes empty on the next start — a half-deleted stack rather than a clean
  one.

- Re-measured after the full stack is up: `bin/dev down` with `KIT_DEV_PROFILES`
  unset leaves **0 containers and 6 volumes**, which is what "stop, keep the
  data" says.


### Changed — the metrics store is gone, and nothing is left dialled at nothing

- **The fourth backend left the stack: mimir.** Its own healthcheck was
  `retries 12 × interval 10s` — 130 seconds of readiness budget per cold start,
  against a 180-second deadline for the whole stack, and 384m of memory — for a
  fleet that does not have the series to put in it. It is **removed rather than
  disabled**: `mimir.yaml` deleted, and with it the compose service, the volume,
  the published port (`15902`), the `KIT_MIMIR_*` variables in `.env.example`,
  the collector's exporter, and the `prometheus`-typed datasource. An exporter
  pointed at a host with nothing behind it is one connection refused per flush,
  forever, in a log nobody reads — while `up --wait` reports the stack healthy.

- **Span metrics are still derived and still redacted; they go to the
  collector's own stdout.** `spanmetrics`, `redaction/cafaye_metrics`,
  `transform/cafaye_metrics_ingest_drop` and `batch` all still run, and
  `exporters: [debug]` is where they land. That is not a consolation prize: it
  keeps the allowlist exercised on real derived metrics rather than only
  asserted about. **Putting a store back is four edits that belong together** —
  the endpoint variable in `.env.example`, the exporter block in
  `otel-collector.yml`, the `exporters:` line on the metrics pipeline, and the
  compose service plus its Grafana datasource. Any subset of them is the
  half-removed backend this will not ship, and two checks now say so out loud.

- **The gate's own assertions follow it out, and two of them got STRONGER.**
  Eight checks were red on this tree, all of them naming a container that no
  longer exists. Each lost the name and kept its shape; two gained a claim that
  could not be made before: the metrics pipeline must export to `debug` **and to
  nothing else**, and Grafana must provision **no** metrics datasource — because
  a datasource nothing fills renders panels that are permanently empty and teach
  a reader that empty means nothing. A third is new: nothing under
  `templates/compose/` may be unreferenced, which is the half of "nothing names a
  container that does not exist" that a hand-written mount list cannot hold.

- **`tests/stack_live_test.sh` reads the metrics out of the collector instead of
  a store.** The two PromQL assertions became three assertions over the
  collector's own `debug` output, at `KIT_OTEL_DEBUG_VERBOSITY=detailed` because
  at `normal` the exporter does not print the attribute map and "the
  high-cardinality dimensions are absent" would be satisfied by the exporter
  being quiet. It now proves something the store never did: that the ingest deny
  set runs on the way out.

- `templates/AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `templates/parity-allowlist`,
  `templates/compose/loki/loki-config.yaml` and the compose header stop saying
  "four" and stop naming a directory that is gone.

### Changed — `bin/dev` starts the cheap stack, and observability is the deliberate spelling

- **`KIT_DEV_PROFILES` defaults to empty.** `templates/bin/dev.sh` read
  `${KIT_DEV_PROFILES-observability}`, so every developer's `bin/dev up` paid for
  four observability backends by default — and the compose file's own readiness
  budgets are the argument: mimir 130s (retries 12 × interval 10s), tempo 65s,
  loki 16s, grafana 20s once and over 180s another time on a cold volume while it
  downloads a plugin zip nobody asked for. Against a 180s stack deadline and a
  76s typical cold start (`RESEARCH-fleet-velocity.md` P1), the default was the
  tax and `KIT_DEV_PROFILES= bin/dev up` — documented as the *escape hatch* — was
  the good path. That is backwards, so it is now the highway:
  `KIT_DEV_PROFILES=observability bin/dev up` brings up tempo, loki and grafana.

- **Telemetry is unaffected, and that is the part worth stating.** The collector
  is not behind the profile, so `<SERVICE>_OTEL_ENDPOINT` still has somewhere to
  send on the default path, and `redaction/*` still runs before anything would be
  stored. On the cheap path the data is dropped because there is no store to hand
  it to, which is strictly better than paying 130 seconds to keep it.

- **Deliberately NOT read from `.env`.** Every other `KIT_*` goes through
  `stack_setting`, which cannot distinguish "unset" from "set to empty" — so a
  `.env` reader here would be a second reader of one fact with different
  semantics, and a `.env` saying `observability` would silently re-impose the tax.

- Docs that described the old default are updated in the same commit
  (`README.md`, `templates/AGENTS.md`, the compose file's header, and `bin/dev`'s
  own `--help` and completion message), because a doc that describes a default
  the script no longer has is drift the next reader pays for.

### Changed — the sweep no longer assumes it owns the database

- **`cafaye.unprotected_tables/0` is scoped to the schemas the substrate was
  applied in**, plus `cafaye` and the session's temporary schema. It scanned
  every table in the database, so the assertion set assumed it owned the
  database: true in `tests/tenancy_test.sh`, false for every adopter whose tests
  build private fixture schemas.

  **Measured, on `identity`** — which adopted this substrate and whose whole-suite
  run then failed kit's own control:

  ```
  sweep/the-only-finding-is-the-control
    expected "cafaye_probe_unprotected:row level security is not enabled"
    actual   "...,account_users:...,api_keys:...,oidc_clients:..."
  ```

  `relforcerowsecurity` is `t` on all five real tables. Those names are
  `identity`'s **fixture** schemas, built by a test helper cloning tables with
  `LIKE … INCLUDING ALL` — and `LIKE` does not copy row-level security, so each
  fixture carries an `account_id` column and no policies. The count moved per run
  (5, then 21) with how many neighbouring tests were mid-flight, which is the
  evidence that it was a reach rather than a defect.

- **The scope is DERIVED from the catalog, not recorded in a table**, and that is
  what makes it an adopter's fix rather than an adopter's migration. A registry
  table would have to be created by the new substrate, so the repair would arrive
  only with a migration — decided by the very proof it repairs. Instead the scope
  is read back out of what the substrate already wrote: `protect_table` names its
  policies `<table>_cafaye_<command>`, so every schema it was applied in is
  discoverable from `pg_policy` with nothing new to install.

- **The scope is per SCHEMA, not per table**, deliberately: a table added next
  month to a schema already in scope is still named, so the sweep keeps its
  growth-guard property rather than only its adopter-safety one. Scoping to
  `cafaye` + `pg_temp` alone — the obvious minimal fix — was rejected: it sweeps
  no real table in any adopter, so its positive control and its empty result are
  both satisfied by a sweep that could never have run.

- **`tests/tenancy_test.sh` gained two assertions, and neither means anything
  alone.** `0b` plants `identity`'s shape — a private fixture schema cloned with
  `LIKE … INCLUDING ALL` — and requires the proof to stay green and the sweep to
  name neither of its tables. `5` plants an unprotected account-scoped table in a
  schema the substrate **does** own, permanently, and requires the proof to go
  red. Narrow the scope to `pg_temp` alone and `0b` passes forever while `5` goes
  red: which is the only reason `5` exists. Both read the catalog before
  asserting on it, so neither can be satisfied by a fixture that failed to
  install.

- **`string_agg` over the sweep carries an explicit `order by`.** The expected
  value is a string, and a string built from an unordered aggregate is a red on a
  correct database whenever the planner is in a different mood.

- **No assertion NAME changed**, so `assertions.txt` and the six drivers are
  untouched, and no enforcement changed: `protect_table`, `begin_account`, the
  four policies and `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` are not in the diff. `FORCE`
  control re-measured: **6 reds before, 6 reds after**, every one an `owner/` or
  `sweep/` row, with the `login/` half green throughout.

### Added — the account boundary, shipped once in kit

- **`templates/database/tenancy/substrate.sql`.** The account boundary inside one
  service's own database: the identity seam (`cafaye.begin_account/1`,
  `cafaye.current_account_id/0`), `cafaye.protect_table/2`, and the sweep
  (`cafaye.unprotected_tables/0`). Measured, before and after.

- **`templates/database/tenancy/isolation.sql` + `assertions.txt`.** The assertion
  set — **39 assertions**, run twice, once as the login role and once as the
  owner — and the manifest they are compared against. `templates/database/<lang>/
  tenancy_test.*` drives it in all six languages kit templates.

- **`FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`, and a proof it is load-bearing.** It is in no
  guide and **no lint in this fleet checked for it** — measured across all nine
  account-scoped services: zero `ROW LEVEL SECURITY`, zero `CREATE POLICY`, zero
  non-owner login roles. On a protected three-row table, read as the owner
  carrying another tenant's identity: **1 row with FORCE, 3 without.**
  `tests/tenancy_test.sh` deletes the statement and requires six assertions to go
  red — all of them `owner/` or `sweep/`, with the `login/` half staying green,
  which is what makes the control specific rather than merely present. With the
  credential fixture added it is **eleven** red on the same terms, and the five new
  ones are the credential half's owner rows: an owner that bypasses its own table
  turns a resolution context into a browsing context, which is exactly the failure
  a resolution path has to be proved against.

- **Credential resolution — `cafaye.protect_credential_table/3`, the one answer to
  "the account is what the query is for".** `identity` adopted the substrate
  (migration 00016) and then measured, against its real protected `api_keys` table
  and as the OWNER, that a request presenting a scoped token reads **zero** rows:
  the account cannot scope the lookup that is trying to learn it, so every machine
  credential authenticates to a **401 "not found"**. `protect_credential_table` is
  **one call, the same size as `protect_table`'s**, and it protects the table
  exactly as `protect_table` does and then adds a fifth policy:

  ```sql
  using (token_digest = (select cafaye.current_credential_digest()))
  ```

  The predicate lives in the **policy**, not only in the caller's query, which is
  the whole design — policies combine permissively, so a policy saying "a
  credential session may select this table" would be a table-wide `SELECT` and
  every key in the database browsable. The honest semantics, asserted in both
  roles: **a resolution session may read exactly the credential row whose digest
  it presented, and nothing else in the database** — `select *` returns that one
  row, and every other table reads zero. It also cannot write (so a resolution
  cannot mint a credential), it is a second transaction-local GUC for the pool
  reason `begin_account/1` is, and `cafaye.credential_tables/0` is the audit that
  answers *which tables can be read with no account*. Rejected and why:
  a `BYPASSRLS` role (right for Supabase's topology, which has a separate service
  role and no per-request one), a `SECURITY DEFINER` function (**does not work
  under `FORCE`** — it applies to the definer), dropping `FORCE`, and leaving
  `api_keys` unprotected. `DECISIONS.md` **MD24** carries the argument and the five
  things the mechanism cannot do.

- **`(select …)` around the identity call, measured rather than asserted.**
  `tests/tenancy_test.sh` counts invocations over five rows on every run:
  **1 wrapped, 5 bare.**

- **`tests/tenancy_test.sh`** — a real cluster from the stack kit ships, the
  substrate applied, the proof run three times (clean, with the FORCE control
  mutated in, and measuring the init plan). Bounded at 1800s in the observability
  phase, next to `tests/isolation_test.sh`.

- **`tests/validate.sh` — `templates/database/tenancy/*  (the account boundary,
  in the templates that enforce it)`.** Ten required strings and five forbidden
  ones in the substrate, **over SQL comments stripped** (the substrate's own
  comments quote every required string while explaining why it exists); four
  required strings in the proof; the eight-name spine asserted to be CONSTRUCTED;
  the manifest and the proof compared **in both directions**; and every one of the
  six drivers required to READ both files on the same line as a read call rather
  than merely mention them. Every list it iterates has an empty-list guard.

- **`tests/validate.sh` — six parse checks for the six drivers**, on the rule
  "parse what you hand out". `templates/database/tenancy/*.sql` are reported as
  parsed by `tests/tenancy_test.sh` rather than by this loop, because a migration's
  syntax is only observable by a server.

- **Self-test breakages 90-92**: `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` removed from the
  substrate; a driver that reads the proof but no longer the manifest; the
  manifest and the proof disagreeing.

### Changed — a second role per service, which changes nothing for a service that has not adopted it

- **`templates/compose/postgres/initdb/10-cluster.sh` provisions `<service>_app`
  beside `<service>`,** grants it CONNECT and the two per-role timeouts, and grants
  it **TO** `<service>` — never the reverse. `<service>` is unchanged: it still owns
  the database and every table, still runs migrations, and still carries the
  `CONNECTION LIMIT`. The app role deliberately does **not** carry one: the budget
  is nine services' worth, and a service that adopts the tenancy templates opens
  its connections as `<service>_app`.

- **Why the role is not optional decoration.** Postgres exempts a table's **owner**
  from its own row-level-security policies, and every service in this fleet runs
  its migrations as its own role. A login role that owns its tables can
  `ALTER TABLE … DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` and can `DROP POLICY`, so an account
  boundary enforced only by policies is one privilege away from meaning nothing.

- **`bin/dev db grant` prints both roles** and both sets of grants, because
  `docker-entrypoint-initdb.d` only runs on a fresh volume and a service
  provisioned before this existed would otherwise have no app role at all.

- **`tests/isolation_test.sh` asserts the role topology**, including the direction
  that is NOT allowed: `<service>_app` must not be a member of `<service>`.

- **`tests/artifacts.json` gains ten rows** — the substrate, the isolation script
  and manifest as one bundle, the README, and one driver per language. All marked
  `optional`, because a service holding no customer rows is core's **honest
  zero** and must be able to say `accountScoped: false` without carrying a
  row-level-security substrate it has nothing to scope. Optional is not the same
  as unexamined: `tests/validate.sh` asserts all ten exist in this repository.

- **`templates/database/contract.json` gains a `tenancy` block**, rather than a
  second contract file: `requiredSettings` says what a generated config must
  carry, `tenancy` says what the substrate must contain, and two subjects belong
  in one machine-readable place rather than two that can disagree.

### Not changed, deliberately

- **`core`.** `schemas/tenant-isolation.schema.json`, `docs/tenancy.md` and
  `harness/tenancy_check.py` are untouched. `tenancy.yml` remains a service's
  DECLARATION of where its scoping happens and which test proves it; what ships
  here is the ENFORCEMENT that makes the declaration honest. A service still
  carries its own `where account_id = ?` on every query, and `core` still requires
  it — RLS is defence in depth, not a licence to delete the predicate, which is
  also what makes the query indexable.

- **Any service.** Nothing was adopted anywhere. The nine services keep their
  hand-written predicates until the adoption wave, and `templates/parity-allowlist`
  is unchanged rather than padded with nine new `absent` rows this packet cannot
  verify.

### Added — a check for the one defect the static phase was structurally unable to see

- **`tests/validate.sh` — `conflict_markers_absent`, run as the first check of the
  static phase.** Found by this packet's own merge: two merge-conflict markers
  reached `origin/master` here and in `billing`, and the residue in both was a
  `CHANGELOG.md`.

- **Why no existing check caught it.** Not oversight — a category the static
  phase cannot cover. Every parse in that phase runs over YAML, JSON, shell, Go,
  Ruby, Python and compose, and all of them were clean. Both markers were in
  *prose*, which this suite reads for the presence of headings and never parses
  for content. A half-resolved merge is still valid markdown: all three marker
  forms at the start of a line render as ordinary text, so nothing downstream
  objects and the suite reports green on a tree that is wrong.

- **All three forms are matched, and that is the part worth having.** What
  actually got through was the `||||||| base` line that `diff3` writes *beside*
  the `<<<<<<<` / `=======` / `>>>>>>>` triple. Resolving a merge by hand
  removes the triple and leaves the base marker, so the result *looks* resolved to
  anyone skimming the diff — and `grep -c '<<<<<<<'` reports `0` on a tree that
  is still wrong. A check for the classic pair alone would have stayed green
  through exactly the case that reached master.

- **The pattern is written `^<{7} `, not as seven literal angle brackets.** That
  is load-bearing. A checker whose own source contains the literal marker line
  flags itself, and both conventional escapes are worse than the problem:
  excluding the checker from its own scan leaves a hole in the one file most
  likely to hold residue, and suppressing the finding wholesale makes the check
  unable to report the truth. The interval form is a *regex*, so the literal
  sequence never appears in the file and the check is self-excluding by
  construction rather than by exception.

- **Measured, not assumed.** Proved green on the tree, red on the real tree with
  a base-only marker injected (reported as `CHANGELOG.md:4249`, naming file and
  line), and green again after the revert. Against a fixture it flags all three
  forms and stays quiet on the four things that must stay quiet: its own source
  line, prose that merely *discusses* markers mid-sentence, six angle brackets,
  and a binary file carrying the bytes.

### Fixed — an `options:` key GitHub does not accept had silently stopped the whole fleet's CI from running

- **`.github/workflows/ci.reusable.yml`, five checks in `tests/validate.sh`,
  `AGENTS.md`, and `tests/self_test.sh`. Found by `actionlint`, not by a failing
  check — which is the point of the last part of this entry.**

  The `language` input carried an `options:` list from 2026-09-30 until now.
  `workflow_call` inputs accept `description`, `required`, `type` and
  `default`; `options:` belongs to `workflow_dispatch`, which is a different
  event with a different schema. GitHub does not ignore an unknown key under
  `workflow_call` — it **rejects the entire workflow file at parse time.**

  Every service in the fleet calls this workflow. So from that date until this
  commit, every CI run in every repository started **zero jobs** and reported
  **zero check runs**, while all 200+ of kit's static checks stayed green.
  Nothing was red because nothing ran. The workflow file was not merely
  degraded; it was not a workflow.

- **`actionlint` named it in one line and 214 checks did not:**
  ```
  .github/workflows/ci.reusable.yml:60:9: unexpected key "options" for inputs at
  workflow_call event. expected one of "default", "description", "required", "type"
  ```
  A sweep of every workflow in the fleet found this one file and no other.

- **The fix is a job, not a list.** `options:` was doing one job — rejecting a
  value no language job handles — and it did it by making the value
  unexpressible. Without a dropdown that guarantee is gone: `language: golang`
  matches no `if: inputs.language == '…'` condition, so all eight language jobs
  skip and the run goes green having tested nothing. A new first job named
  `language` now runs unconditionally and `case`es the value, failing the run on
  anything it does not recognise. That is strictly stronger than the dropdown:
  the dropdown was a UI affordance, this is a gate.

- **A new check, `reusable workflows (workflow_call inputs use only documented
  keys)`, so the class cannot recur.** It is deliberately **not** a full Actions
  schema validator — it cannot know about expression contexts, runner labels or
  `uses:` resolution — and it asserts exactly one property: every key directly
  under a `workflow_call` input is one GitHub documents for that event. Its
  message names `options` and says what to do instead, because a message naming
  the key is one the next author can act on.

- **Five checks were reading the illegal key, which is how the defect stayed
  invisible.** `ci_check`, `kit_languages`, `mise_check`, `tier_declaration_check`
  and `tier_demand_check` all read the `options:` list as *the* list of languages
  kit ships — and `tests/artifacts.json`'s `{lang}` check read it too. Removing
  an illegal key correctly turned all five red. They now read the gate job's
  `case` statement, which is where the enumeration actually lives, so the list
  and the thing that enforces it are the same object rather than two copies that
  can drift.

- **Each of those five now refuses to pass on an empty list.** Deleting or
  renaming the gate job used to make every one of them loop zero times and
  report success — the same failure mode as the outage itself, one level down.
  Verified by mutation: with the gate job renamed away, **six** checks go red
  (it was two before the guards were added). A check that could not ask its
  question now says so.

- **`tests/self_test.sh` breakage 89** re-adds the exact key to the exact input
  and asserts that named check catches it. The proof failed before the check
  existed and passes after; the unbroken tree is green on both sides.

### Fixed — kit's own remediation advice was telling services to make themselves a cluster superuser

- **`tests/fleet_check.py`, `README.md`, `templates/AGENTS.md`,
  `templates/database/README.md` and `templates/compose/docker-compose.yml`'s own
  header — five copies of one wrong sentence, all corrected, and a check added
  because correcting prose alone would have left the gap open from the other
  side.** The stale-copy finding ended *"Point it at its own database by
  overriding the `postgres` service's environment (POSTGRES_DB /
  POSTGRES_USER)"*, and the adoption-path block printed the same instruction to
  every unadopted repository in the fleet. It was wrong in a way that does not
  merely fail to help.

- **Measured, on a cluster built from this repository's own
  `initdb/10-cluster.sh` against `postgres:17` — not inferred.** A service that
  follows the advice and sets `POSTGRES_USER: <itself>` gets a role the official
  image created, and the image creates it as a **superuser**. One cluster, with
  one service provisioned the supported way and one the overridden way
  (`KIT_POSTGRES_DATABASES=courier`, `POSTGRES_USER=identity`):

  ```
  $ psql -U identity -d identity -tAc \
      "select rolname, rolsuper from pg_roles where rolname not like 'pg\_%'"
   courier|f         <- made by the init script: NOSUPERUSER
   identity|t        <- made by the image, for the service's own name
  ```

  That is the whole of `10-cluster.sh:108`'s `LOGIN NOSUPERUSER NOCREATEDB
  NOCREATEROLE NOREPLICATION`, undone by the override the same repository
  recommended. The consequence, from inside that cluster:

  ```
  $ psql -U identity -d courier -tAc "select count(*) from invoices"
  2
  $ psql -U courier  -d identity -tAc "select token from sessions"
  psql: error: FATAL:  permission denied for database "identity"
  DETAIL:  User does not have CONNECT privilege.
  ```

  The second is `MD21d`'s boundary refusing a service — at the door, before a
  table is even named — and the first is the same query not being refused.

- **The other two keys stop the CLUSTER, not just the service.** The image
  creates `POSTGRES_USER` and `POSTGRES_DB` *before* any init script runs, so
  `CREATE ROLE` / `CREATE DATABASE` in the script then find them already there.
  `admin()` runs psql with `ON_ERROR_STOP=1` (`10-cluster.sh:78`), this happens
  **during initdb**, and so the whole cluster refuses to start. Measured, both
  shapes, exit status 3:

  ```
  $ docker run -e POSTGRES_USER=identity -e KIT_POSTGRES_DATABASES=identity,courier …
    [cluster] provisioning identity
    ERROR:  role "identity" already exists
  $ docker run -e POSTGRES_DB=identity -e KIT_POSTGRES_DATABASES=identity,courier …
    [cluster] provisioning identity
    ERROR:  database "identity" already exists
  ```

- **`POSTGRES_PASSWORD` is refused for a third reason, and the finding says so
  rather than borrowing the other two.** It breaks neither the cluster nor the
  boundary. It is the credential every role is handed (`10-cluster.sh:107` passes
  `$POSTGRES_PASSWORD` to each), so one service's file chooses it for all the
  others — measured, a service overriding it authenticates `courier` with its
  own password on a fresh volume. It is still refused, and the message says that
  is *why*.

- **The advice is now `KIT_POSTGRES_DATABASES` in `.env`**, which is the
  mechanism the init script was always built around: each name becomes a
  `NOSUPERUSER` role and a database it owns, and the `REVOKE CONNECT ... FROM
  PUBLIC` boundary is applied to it. No compose file at all. The `down -v` that
  goes with it is in the message too, because `docker-entrypoint-initdb.d` runs
  once per volume and a developer who adds their name and runs `up` gets a
  cluster that looks fine and a database that was never created.

- **`check_override_surface` grew a check, and `tests/self_test.sh` grew
  breakage 83.** A service that sets any of the three on kit's `postgres` is now
  a finding, in the same family as the `otel-collector` `volumes:`/`command:`
  rule — a service reaching into a boundary that belongs to the whole fleet.
  Self-test breakage count 82 → 83.

- **The false-positive analysis is written down in the check, because a check
  that cries wolf gets deleted.** The rule fires only on an entry with **no
  `image:` and no `build:`**, so a service shipping its own postgres under kit's
  service name stays `check_stale_copy`'s finding alone — one defect, one
  finding. It keys on the CLUSTER service name (derived from
  `KIT_POSTGRES_DATABASES`, not written down as `"postgres"`), so a service
  setting `POSTGRES_DB` on its **own** service — the ordinary connection-string
  case — is untouched, and every existing self-test fixture is that green
  control without a new one. `env_file:` is deliberately not read: `.env` is
  git-ignored, and every legitimate way of setting any of the three is the
  `KIT_POSTGRES_*` variable, which never appears as a `POSTGRES_*` key in a
  service's compose file.

- **Found in the fleet for real, by a worker doing an unrelated migration.**
  `identity` carried precisely the override kit recommended. On re-measurement
  it is not the only one: **`billing` and `courier` carry it too**, and all
  three have a `kit.ref`, so this check turns three repositories from green to
  FAIL against a standard they have already adopted. That is the check working,
  not a regression — but it is a real change in what the fleet gate reports, and
  it is called out here rather than discovered by whoever runs the gate next.

- **`REPORT-kit-13.md` is left as it was.** Its line 95 is a verbatim copy of the
  output as it was printed, and a dated report is a record of what a packet did.
  Rewriting it would make the history lie about itself.

### Added — `image.reusable.yml`: the fleet's images are now built by something

**Nothing in the fleet built the image its deploy config names.** Every
deployable service has a `config/deploy.yml` saying `image: <org>/<repo>` with
`registry.server: ghcr.io`, and as of kit-32 not one repository had a workflow, a
Makefile target or a script that produced that artifact. `config/deploy.yml` was
a description of a deploy whose input had no pipeline behind it, so
`kamal build push` on an operator's laptop was the only way the image came to
exist — one machine, one person, no record of which commit it was built from.

The new `.github/workflows/image.reusable.yml` is called rather than copied, for
the same reason `ci.reusable.yml` is:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/publish.yml, in a service repository
on:
  push:
    branches: [master]
permissions:
  contents: read
  packages: write        # the caller's to grant — a reusable workflow cannot
jobs:                    # grant itself a permission
  image:
    uses: cafaye/kit/.github/workflows/image.reusable.yml@master
    with:
      push: true
```

Five decisions in it, each of which is a decision somebody could get wrong in a
way that still produces a green run:

- **GitHub Packages, with `GITHUB_TOKEN` as the only credential.** No PAT, no
  `secrets:` entry, no registry account, nothing to rotate. The caller grants
  `packages: write`; without it the push fails 401, which reads like a wrong
  password rather than a missing grant, so the header says so at the example.
- **`push` defaults to `false`.** Publishing is opt-in at the call site. A
  reusable workflow that pushed by default would publish from every caller that
  only meant to check a Dockerfile still builds.
- **The image name is DERIVED — `ghcr.io/${{ github.repository }}`,
  lowercased — and is not an input.** An input is a string each service copies
  into its own repository, and a copied string drifts from the repository it
  names; CI would push to one place while `kamal` pulled from another and the
  deploy would fail hours later on a release whose build was green. The
  lowercasing is a real step rather than a comment, because GitHub Packages
  404s an uppercase path and says so by naming a package.
- **Tags are `sha-<full 40>`, `<branch>`, and `latest`; no semver.** The sha tag
  is immutable, so a deploy that names it means it. A semver tag here would let
  a release pin `v1.0.0` to whichever commit happened to be on master that week.
- **`provenance: mode=max` and `sbom: true`**, costing two referrers, because a
  registry of launch artifacts with no recorded provenance cannot be audited
  after the fact and adding it later means it was never there.

The build also refuses to publish from a `pull_request` even if a caller adds
that trigger — the condition is `inputs.push && github.event_name !=
'pull_request'`, which is the fork that `GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot write to anyway,
refused before the attempt rather than after it.

### Fixed — the copy check was a freeze, and a second standard made it say so

Adding the workflow above made kit's own `callable_check` go **red**, reporting
`a second workflow declaring workflow_call exists` — naming, as drift, a second
*standard* added on purpose. The rule it enforced was "exactly one file in the
tree may declare `workflow_call`", which is not a drift check. It is a freeze,
and following it would mean kit could never grow past one standard no matter how
many the fleet needed.

It is now: files at paths declared in a new `REUSABLE_WORKFLOWS` variable are
exempt, and every other file is judged on its **parsed `name:`**, with the two
failures reported as the two different mistakes they are —

- same `name:` as a declared standard → a **copy** parked where no caller can
  reach it, which is the original defect and is still the failure the walk
  exists to catch;
- a different `name:` → an **undeclared standard**, a callable workflow kit ships
  without listing, which is this packet's own bug class one file over.

Declaring the second path also asserted, for the first time, that every path in
the list exists and is callable — otherwise widening the list would have exempted
a path with no file behind it, quietly weakening the check it was added to
police.

**Both new branches are proved by breakage** (78 and 79), because a widened
check is a check that may have been widened into uselessness and the only way to
know is to break it in both directions it now claims to cover. Breakage 78 is
the original defect and 79 is the one the widening made possible; a check that
had been reporting a defect that did not exist and now reports nothing at all is
a plausible sentence, and as far as anyone would know an accurate one.

### Fixed — the shared cluster worked for exactly one tenant, and the identifier rule was half a rule

Both of these were found by **running a second tenant**, which is the operation
"one Postgres cluster for the whole fleet, a database and a role per service" is
actually made of. Everything kit had checked about the cluster was true of the
first service and untested for the second — and the second is the case that makes
the shared cluster worth having.

**1. Two tenants separated by a space became one database, and the stack said it worked.**

```console
$ KIT_POSTGRES_DATABASES="billing neighbour" bin/dev up
postgres-1 | [cluster] provisioning billingneighbour
postgres-1 | [cluster] done: 1 service database(s), one role each, PUBLIC holds CONNECT on none of them
```

One database, named after both services fused together, on a healthy-looking
stack. The parse split on commas and then ran `tr -d '[:space:]'` over each
entry to tolerate `billing, neighbour`, so a space *instead of* a comma arrived
at `require_identifier` with the space already deleted — a perfectly legal
identifier.

That is why nothing caught it. `require_identifier`'s own comment names this as
the failure worth preventing — *"builds one identifier out of two tokens"* — but
the only route to that outcome produced an **identifer that passed validation**,
and every check in kit was looking at a single name. The fused database exists,
the second service's migrations then fail against a database nobody created, and
the service that does have one reports clean.

Outer whitespace is now trimmed and inner whitespace is refused by name, with the
separator that was probably meant.

**2. `require_identifier` was enforcing about half of what its error message said.**

The rule is built entirely from shell bracket ranges — `[!a-z_]`,
`[![:a-z0-9_]]` — and those follow **collation**, which is locale-dependent.
Under `en_US.UTF-8`, the default on the machine this fleet is developed on,
collation is case-insensitive at the primary level, so `[!a-z]` does not match
`B`. Measured, same pattern, two locales:

```console
$ LC_ALL=C          bash -c 'case Billing in [!a-z_]*) echo REFUSE;; *) echo ACCEPT;; esac'
REFUSE
$ LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 bash -c '…'
ACCEPT
```

So `Billing`, `BILLING` and `cafayé` were all accepted while the error string
promised `must match [a-z_][a-z0-9_]*`.

This is **not** injection: the characters that would break out of an unquoted
identifier still sort outside `[a-z]` and were refused under either locale. It is
a quieter failure with a worse shape. Postgres folds unquoted identifiers to lower
case, so `KIT_POSTGRES_DATABASES=Billing` and `…=billing` name **the same
database** — two services differing only in case would share one database and one
role, which is exactly the harm `require_identifier`'s message says it exists to
prevent, arriving by the one route that yields a legal-looking name.

`10-cluster.sh` now exports `LC_ALL=C`. That is the whole fix rather than
rewriting the pattern with `[[:lower:]]`, because the locale also governs `tr`,
`sort` and `printf` further down, and a provisioning script that compares strings
differently depending on whose laptop ran it is not deterministic in any sense
that matters.

**What now checks both.** `tests/multi_tenant_split_test.sh` is kit's first check
that asks what a *second* tenant does. It runs the shipped init script with
`psql` stubbed — the real parse, the real refusals, no container and no volume —
and covers 28 cases: the fused-name refusal, the four legitimate comma-separated
spellings people actually write, empty and trailing entries, `require_identifier`
still refusing what it refused before, and the identifier rule re-checked under
`C`, `en_US.UTF-8`, `en_GB.UTF-8` and `POSIX` with a legal name alongside each so
the fix cannot pass by refusing everything. Breakage 88 reverts the parse and
watches it go red.

The honest summary of why these survived: **every proof kit held about the
cluster was a proof about the first tenant.** A fleet of nine services is nine
repetitions of a case nobody had run twice.

### Fixed — the shared cluster provisioned nothing, and reported itself healthy

Two defects, and the reason they survived is the same one: each was invisible to
every check kit had, and together they meant **no service in this fleet has ever
had a database on the shared cluster.** Both are fixed here, both are now
checked, and the checks are derived from the files rather than from a list.

**1. `docker-entrypoint-initdb.d` was mounted from an empty directory, always.**
`templates/compose/docker-compose.yml` mounted the init scripts as
`./postgres/initdb`, and `bin/dev` runs compose with `--project-directory .` — the
**service** root. Docker Compose resolves a relative bind source and build context
against the *project directory*, not against the directory holding the compose
file, so `./postgres/initdb` meant `<service>/postgres/initdb`. No service has
that directory. Docker's answer to a missing bind source is to **create it as an
empty directory**, so there was no error to see.

Measured, on `identity`, before this fix:

    $ docker exec cafaye-postgres-1 ls /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/
    (nothing)
    $ docker exec cafaye-postgres-1 psql -U cafaye -d postgres \
        -tAc "select rolname,rolsuper from pg_roles where rolname not like 'pg\_%'"
    cafaye|t
    $ docker compose up -d --wait postgres ; echo $?
    0        # and the container reports HEALTHY

`10-cluster.sh` never ran. No service got a role, no service got a database, no
`REVOKE CONNECT ... FROM PUBLIC` was ever applied — and the stack came up green,
which is the one outcome a provisioning contract must never produce. The same
wall was hit independently by the courier-27 worker, who worked around it rather
than patching the stack it fetches.

The fix is the one the other five services in that file already use:
`${KIT_COMPOSE_DIR:-.}/postgres`, which `bin/dev` exports
(`templates/bin/dev.sh:652`). After it, the same command shows `identity|f|50`
and a database named `identity`, created by the script, with no override file and
no manual SQL.

**2. `.env.example` named one service as the whole fleet's default tenant.**
`KIT_POSTGRES_DATABASES` defaulted to `courier` in the compose file *and* in
`.env.example`, and `bin/dev` copies `.env.example` verbatim into each service's
git-ignored `.env` — which Compose resolves **ahead of** a service's own
committed `docker-compose.yml`. So the literal did not act as a default; it
**cancelled** every adopting service's own declaration, on every machine where
`bin/dev` had run, with nothing in any diff. Measured on `identity`: its compose
file said `${KIT_POSTGRES_DATABASES:-identity}`, the copied `.env` said
`courier`, and the cluster provisioned `courier`.

The same mechanism made a *second* committed value inert in the same run.
`identity`'s compose file raised `KIT_POSTGRES_ROLE_CONNECTIONS` to 50; the
copied `.env` said 10; `pg_roles.rolconnlimit` was 10; and **175 tests failed**
with `FATAL: too many connections for role "identity"` — a failure caused
entirely by a value the repository had already raised, reviewed and merged. Both
variables are now empty in `.env.example`, and the rule is written out there: *a
value in this file defeats a service's committed compose file.*

`KIT_POSTGRES_DATABASES` in the compose file loses its `:-courier` fallback
entirely rather than gaining an empty one, and the reason is measured rather than
preferred. An empty default is the obvious repair and it is wrong: bringing the
template up with it produces, from `10-cluster.sh:48`,

    KIT_POSTGRES_DATABASES: KIT_POSTGRES_DATABASES is unset. Name the services,
    comma-separated. A service with no entry has no database, and its migrations
    fail against a database that was never created.

and a container that exits 1. That failure is the *correct* one — far better than
the default it replaces, which handed a real service's database to whoever
adopted the template — so the list stays required, compose passes it through
unset, and a service that forgot to declare itself gets that message instead of
somebody else's rows.

**What now fails if either comes back.** Three rules, all derived from the files:

- *No host path in `docker-compose.yml` may be bare-relative.* The pre-existing
  guard listed five vendor configs by name, which is why it missed the postgres
  service's two paths — a check over a list only ever says something about the
  list. This one reads the file, so an eighth service cannot escape it.
- *No tenant as a shared default.* `KIT_POSTGRES_DATABASES` holds service names,
  so a non-empty fallback in a template nine services fetch is a hardcoded
  tenant. The rule does **not** extend to `KIT_POSTGRES_ROLE_CONNECTIONS`:
  `10` is a blast-radius default, not a tenant, and conflating the two would
  have had the check demanding the cluster stop having a connection limit.
- *An empty value must be CAUGHT, not merely absent.* Emptiness with no fallback
  is a silent breakage; emptiness the init script refuses by name is a loud one
  naming the fix. The rule checks for the guard in `10-cluster.sh` rather than
  trusting a comment asserting it exists.

Two of these three caught their own author. The `.env.example` rule rejected the
empty `KIT_POSTGRES_DATABASES` default described above, which is why that default
is gone rather than shipped; and the first version of the tenant rule failed on
the *comment* documenting the old value, because it scanned raw text and could
not tell a sentence about a value from the value. Comments are stripped before
both scans now.

The connection-budget check was reading `KIT_POSTGRES_DATABASES` and
`KIT_POSTGRES_ROLE_CONNECTIONS` out of `.env.example`, which no longer carries
them, so it began describing a cluster that cannot exist. It now resolves each
value through the chain the container actually sees — `.env.example`, then the
compose `:-` fallback, then the init script's own — and, with no tenant declared
by default, asserts the budget against the nine services this template's prose
claims to serve (`9 × 10 + 8 = 98 ≤ 200`) rather than against `0 × 10 + 8`, which
is true of every number ever written and so proves nothing.

### Fixed — `self_test_claims` was reporting six findings on an unrenumbered comment

`tests/self_test.sh` has a check (`self_test_claims`, run by the gate) that
cross-checks the file's **header** — every breakage it documents — against the
**recipes** it actually carries, and fails when either side names a number the
other does not. On `master` it was reporting six findings, in both directions:

```
header documents breakage 63 but no recipe carries it
header documents breakage 64 but no recipe carries it
header documents breakage 65 but no recipe carries it
recipe proves breakage 78 but the header does not document it
recipe proves breakage 79 but the header does not document it
recipe proves breakage 80 but the header does not document it
recipe proves breakage 81 but the header does not document it
recipe proves breakage 82 but the header does not document it
```

One comment caused all of it. The Kamal block in the header was written as
`61-65`; its five recipes were renumbered to `78-82` by `4a037f3` — whose own
body note records the collision that forced the move — and the header was not
carried along. The reason this was not a tidy-up but a real defect is that
**61 and 62 were reused**: by that point they belonged to the licence
breakages, which genuinely exist. So the header was describing two different
sets of proofs under the same two numbers, and the integrity check was
reporting the disagreement rather than causing it.

The header block is renumbered to `78-82` and its prose follows its recipes.
`self_test_claims` now reports agreement. Worth recording for the next person
who renumbers anything in that file: the header is not documentation, it is
**input to a check**, and the check is the only thing standing between a
renumbered recipe and a set of proofs the file claims but does not run.

### Fixed — a check that guarded the initdb mount was reading a comment about it

This is a regression *introduced by the fix above*, found by that fix's own
proof, and it is recorded because a check that cannot fail is worse than a
missing check: it is a check that reports success.

`cluster_topology_check` asserts that the postgres service mounts anything at
`/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d`, and it did so with `if "<path>" not in block`
over the raw YAML text of the service. Correct when the only mention of that
path was the mount. The fix above adds a comment explaining why the mount must
be `${KIT_COMPOSE_DIR:-.}/postgres/initdb` rather than `./postgres/initdb`, and
that comment quotes the path.

Measured, on this tree, with the mount deleted and nothing else changed:

| | `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d` occurrences in the postgres block |
|---|---|
| before the fix | 1 — the mount |
| after the fix | 2 — the mount, and the comment about the mount |

So deleting the mount left the comment, `in` returned true, and
`cluster_topology_check` went **green**. Deleting the same line from `origin/master`
turns it red, which is how the difference was isolated to this change rather than
to the check having always been broken.

This is the third time in this release that a check scanning YAML text has
matched a sentence about a value instead of the value — the other two being the
`.env.example` tenant rule and the connection-budget scan. All three are now the
same shape, and the general statement is the one worth keeping: **a check that
reads compose text to decide whether something is wired can be satisfied by a
comment saying it is wired.** `cluster_topology_check` now strips comment lines
before both of its assertions — the mount, and the set of `KIT_POSTGRES_*` the
service passes into the container — so a well-commented file no longer passes for
a well-wired one. The durable fix is to parse the YAML rather than scan it; that
is not in this release, and until it lands every text-scanning check in this file
carries the same hazard.

### Fixed — a comment inside an unquoted heredoc ran as a command, and the gate stayed green

Also a regression *introduced by the fix above*, and the second one in this
release to be found by being wrong in the same place: the first was a check
reading a comment, this one is a comment being read by a shell.

`tests/stack_live_test.sh` writes its fixture `.env` with
`cat >"$SERVICE/.env" <<ENV`. The delimiter is unquoted **on purpose** —
`$REMOTE`, `$WORK` and the port arithmetic all have to expand. The price of that
is that the heredoc body is a shell script, and the fix above's explanation of
why `tests/stack_live_test.sh` now has to declare a tenant was written *inside*
it, with backticks around the filenames.

So bash ran every backticked word as a command. The first run after that edit
printed:

```
tests/stack_live_test.sh: line 227: docker-compose.yml: command not found
tests/stack_live_test.sh: line 227: KIT_POSTGRES_DATABASES: command not found
tests/stack_live_test.sh: line 227: bin/dev: No such file or directory
tests/stack_live_test.sh: line 227: kit_probe: command not found
```

…and then **exited 0 with all fifteen assertions PASS**, including "the fetched
stack came up healthy". `KIT_POSTGRES_DATABASES=kit_probe` had been swallowed
into a command substitution and never reached the `.env` at all, so the line
every other assertion was relying on was not there.

This is the fourth comment-as-data failure in this release and the first one
where the comment *did something* rather than merely satisfying a substring test.
The general statement is now sharper than the one recorded above: **prose
written into a construct that expands is not prose.** The fix is placement, not
wording — the explanation moved above the `<<ENV`, where it cannot execute, and
the heredoc body is nothing but assignments. The general rule for every heredoc
in this repository is that a comment explaining one belongs *outside* it.

### Fixed — the live stack test caught a regression that 214 static checks and 86 proofs passed

Removing the `:-` fallback from `KIT_POSTGRES_DATABASES` — which is the whole
point of entry 1 above, and which breakages 85 and 86 exist to insist on — broke
`tests/stack_live_test.sh`, which had never declared a tenant because for its
whole life the fallback had been doing it for them.

Nothing noticed. The static gate ran 214 checks and the self-test ran 86
breakage proofs, and every one of them was green, because every one of them
reads the template or a service's committed files — and kit's own test harnesses
are none of those. The live test was the only thing that brought the cluster up,
and it said so in ten minutes and eight containers:

```
/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/10-cluster.sh: line 48: KIT_POSTGRES_DATABASES:
KIT_POSTGRES_DATABASES is unset. Name the services, comma-separated.
bin/dev: stack did not become healthy
```

The init script was right and the harness was wrong, and the reason is worth
stating because it is the general shape of this bug: **kit's own harness
consuming kit's own template looks exactly like "the template broke."** A test
that is also a consumer cannot tell the difference from the inside.

Three things landed here.

**A static check, so it costs a second and not ten minutes.** Every file under
`tests/` that writes a `.env` carrying a `KIT_` variable must declare a tenant in
the same heredoc body — derived from the files, so a harness written tomorrow is
covered the day it is written. It reads the heredoc body rather than the file,
because an assignment outside the heredoc does not reach the `.env` either, and
it matches an assignment at the start of a line with a value rather than the
substring `KIT_POSTGRES_DATABASES`, because this file's own `.env.example`
mentions that name in prose and the comment above the heredoc mentions it too.
Breakage 87 is its red proof. It exits 1 if no harness is found at all, so it
cannot pass by finding nothing.

**Three live assertions, so the file now proves the cluster was provisioned.**
`stack_live_test.sh` previously asserted that eight containers came up healthy
and telemetry flowed — and an empty `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d` produces
exactly that. It now asks the running server: that database `kit_probe` exists
and is owned by role `kit_probe`, that the role exists and is **not** a
superuser, and that `datacl` grants `PUBLIC` nothing. That last one is read by
its empty-grantee shape (`=c/cafaye`) rather than by a search for the word
`PUBLIC`, which appears in no `datacl` at all, and a NULL `datacl` is a failure
rather than a skip because NULL means Postgres's defaults still stand — and the
default is CONNECT to PUBLIC. Red proof: dropping the database and the role from
the running container turns all three red, which is the state an empty initdb
directory produces. It deliberately does not assert the cross-tenant refusal;
`tests/isolation_test.sh` owns that claim and owns it better, and a second
weaker copy of a fact that already has a home helps nobody.

**A general note.** The lesson is not "write more static checks." It is that a
repository has consumers nobody enumerated — its own test harnesses among them —
and a template that got stricter moved the burden onto all of them at once. The
static gate was green because nothing in it looked at the thing that broke.

### Fixed — the postgres accessory no longer publishes its port on every interface

- **`templates/kamal/deploy.yml.erb` — one line deleted, and what replaces it is a
  comment that says why.** The postgres accessory carried `port: 5432`, which is
  valid YAML and which `kamal config` accepts and exits 0 — the two strongest false
  greens available. Kamal expands it (`Configuration::Accessory#port` returns
  `"#{port}:#{port}"` when the value carries no colon) and hands it to
  `docker run --publish` (`Commands::Accessory#publish_args`), and Docker's
  `--publish HOST:CONTAINER` with no host address binds `0.0.0.0` and `::`.

  **Measured, on a real Kamal 2.12.0 boot, not inferred:** a boot with the line
  present fails with
  `Bind for 0.0.0.0:5432 failed: port is already allocated`
  when something else holds 5432 — which is Docker naming the bind it is about to
  make. On a VPS where 5432 is free it succeeds, and the database is on every
  interface the host has. kit does not ship a firewall, and the only thing between
  that and the internet is one the operator wrote.

- **The loopback alternative is not the fix, and the comment says so, because it
  is the obvious answer and it does not work.** `port: "127.0.0.1:5432:5432"`
  really does bind only that host — measured, `docker ps` shows
  `127.0.0.1:5432->5432/tcp` and nothing on `::`. But the application is not on
  the host's loopback: it is a container on the `kamal` Docker network, where
  `127.0.0.1` is its own. Measured, from a container on that network:
  `pg_isready -h 127.0.0.1 -p 5432` gets **no response**, while
  `pg_isready -h <service>-postgres -p 5432` **answers**. So the loopback bind
  reduces the exposure, does not make the application work, and the only thing it
  buys is a `psql` on the box itself.

- **What the application uses instead, measured rather than argued.** Kamal boots
  the accessory with `--network kamal` and `--name <service_name>`, Docker's
  embedded DNS resolves that name, and the app reaches the database at
  `<service>-postgres:5432`. Measured from **inside a deployed app container**
  with this template and no `port:` line: `pg_isready -h <service>-postgres -p
  5432` → `accepting connections`, and `docker ps` for the accessory shows
  `5432/tcp` with no host binding at all.

  **`DATABASE_URL` must therefore name the container, not the server.** That is
  the one migration this costs, and it is a one-line change per service in a file
  that is already a secret and already per-service. The fleet's own probe URLs
  already use the container-name form, which is independent evidence that
  name-based access is the intended shape.

- **`tests/kamal_test.sh` — two new cases, and one of them is a control.** The
  first asserts that the **resolved** accessories block (read back from the real
  `kamal config`, not grepped out of the template) carries no `port:`. The second
  plants the line it forbids and asserts the same check catches it, because a grep
  that finds nothing because it read nothing is the failure mode a negative test
  has by construction.

  Both were needed more than expected. The first version of the block-extraction
  was `sed -n '/^:accessories:/,/^[^-:]/p'`, which stops on `  postgres:` the
  very next line — `p` is neither `-` nor `:` — so it read a two-line document and
  the case passed for the wrong reason; the control caught it, which is what a
  control is for.

### Added — Kamal deploy and backup configuration, and the custom toolchain removed

- **`templates/kamal/` — the deploy and backup configuration a service copies,
  in the shape `kamal` and `kamal-backup` already expect.** Four files:
  `deploy.yml.erb`, `kamal-backup.yml.erb`, `drill.sh`, and a README.

  kit does not ship a deployment tool or a backup tool. `kamal` and
  `kamal-backup` are both, both are installed wherever cafaye deploys, and
  kit-20 demonstrated the cost of the alternative by building one: **3,012 lines
  across seven files** — the four in `templates/backup/`, plus
  `templates/bin/backup.sh`, `docker/Dockerfile.backup` and
  `tests/backup_test.sh` — reimplementing a command surface that already
  existed. 1,411 of those were shipped code and configuration. Every one of those
  files is **removed**, and
  `tests/validate.sh` asserts their absence — "we removed it" has no mechanical
  form until something checks, and self_test breakage 64 resurrects one file to
  prove that check is load-bearing.

  What each custom feature maps to, and where it went:

  | custom | kamal-backup | 
  |---|---|
  | `pg_dump` piped into `restic backup` | `backup` |
  | `schedule.crontab` | `backup.schedule: 1d` — state in a volume, so a reboot does not trigger a full dump |
  | retention flags by hand | `restic.retention` |
  | `restic init` if absent | `restic.init_if_missing` |
  | `redact.py` wrapped around every command | the gem's own `Redactor`, applied to every command including the drill's check output |
  | a hand-written restore path | `restore production`, `restore local` |
  | a hand-written drill | `drill production` |
  | a hand-written redacted report | `evidence` |

- **`config/kamal-backup.yml` names ONE database, and says why.** The queue,
  cache and cable databases are rebuildable working data; backing them up
  snapshots caches and job bookkeeping. The restore is the product: one database
  means one restore path and one row count an operator can check by eye.

- **`drill.sh` — the two things kamal-backup does not do, both found by reading
  the gem rather than by using it.** `restore_to_scratch`
  (`databases/base.rb:52-55`) validates, restores, and does **not drop the
  scratch database** — the only `DROP SCHEMA` in the gem runs against the *live*
  database — so cleanup is an operator's job, and a step remembered after a
  failure is a step that does not happen after a failure. And the gem decides the
  drill passed by the **exit status** of `--check` (`app.rb:307-325`), which
  makes `psql -tAc "SELECT count(*) FROM t"` useless: it exits 0 for zero rows, so
  a restore of an empty database is reported as a successful drill. The wrapper
  therefore drops the scratch database on every exit path with `WITH (FORCE)`, and
  generates a `DO $$ … RAISE EXCEPTION` block under `ON_ERROR_STOP=1` so an empty
  table becomes a non-zero exit. There is no default table list — a drill with no
  `--table` is a usage error rather than a drill that quietly passes.

- **`tests/kamal_test.sh` — the gate EXECUTES the generated config.** 22 cases,
  every one against the **real** `kamal` and the real `kamal-backup`. This is the
  one place kit hands out YAML a third-party binary has to accept, and a parse
  check cannot do the job: three real defects in these templates' own first draft
  were valid YAML that `yaml.safe_load` called fine —

  - a doubled registry host. `image: ghcr.io/org/repo` with
    `registry.server: ghcr.io` resolves to `ghcr.io/ghcr.io/org/repo` (measured:
    `kamal config` reports it), and `kamal config` still exits **0**. The deploy
    fails at the push.
  - a missing `builder.arch`. Valid YAML; kamal refuses the file outright with
    "Builder arch not set".
  - a secret named in `config/kamal-backup.yml` and missing from the backup
    accessory's `env.secret`. **Both files are valid and neither is internally
    inconsistent** — `kamal-backup validate` builds the accessory's environment
    from the deploy config alone, so only running the pair finds it.

  self_test breakages 61, 62 and 65 are those three, inverted.

- **Retention is written out rather than inherited.** kamal-backup 0.5.2's
  `DEFAULT_RETENTION` happens to be exactly the five numbers the template states,
  so omitting the block would work today. A retention policy living in a
  dependency's defaults is a policy that changes on a version bump, and the diff
  at that moment is about the gem rather than about how far back a restore can
  reach.

- **A missing `KIT_*` variable fails the render by name.** `<%= ENV['X'] %>` with
  `X` unset renders an empty string, which YAML reads as a null list item and
  which surfaces three layers away as a deploy that cannot find a host. The
  templates `raise` and name the variable instead.

### Changed

- **`templates/kamal/README.md` answers the Ruby question explicitly, because it
  is a boundary and not a caveat.** The service image contains no Ruby. The backup
  accessory **ships its own**, which is why the `backup` block in `deploy.yml.erb`
  is an ordinary accessory. `kamal` is a Ruby gem and always has been — an
  operator deploying with Kamal has Ruby, and that is not a requirement kit adds.
  A service that wants backups and no `kamal-backup` gem locally **still gets
  backups**, because the accessory's scheduler loop is what takes snapshots; what
  it loses is `restore local` and `drill local`, not the backups. ERB costs
  nothing extra because Kamal evaluates `config/deploy.yml` through
  `ERB#result` itself.

### Fixed

- **four self-test recipes asserted a string the check does not emit.** All four
  were *correct checks* on *correct mutations* whose recipe could not tell either
  from a failure, and all four reported "the gate went red, but NOT via …" —
  three of them while printing the needle two lines above the complaint.

  `expect_red_check` matches `FAIL $want`, so the needle has to be the check's
  **label**. Breakages 75, 76 and 77 asserted the finding's own wording
  (`"which is the image kit's stack already ships"`, `"promises a command the
  script does not dispatch"`), and those strings are printed as indented detail
  lines *under* the `FAIL <label>` header. Breakage 71 asserted
  `the connection budget  (max_connections covers` against a label that read
  `max_connions` — a misspelling of a setting that does not exist, in the one line
  a reader greps for to learn what a check measures.

  Two consequences beyond the four recipes. The `max_connions` label is corrected
  to `max_connections`, which is the variable the check reads. And a check label
  that a self-test asserts is now a **contract**: renaming one silently un-proofs
  the breakage, which is the same coupling as the `callable path` check and is now
  written down in `AGENTS.md` with the diagnostic to use next time — read the real
  FAIL line before assuming the check missed the defect.

- **the connection-contract check was satisfied by a comment.** It tested
  `if key not in body` over the whole snippet, and the go snippet's header says
  "1. `application_name` — THE ONE THAT IS NOT OPTIONAL". So deleting the single
  line that *sets* it left the substring in the file and the contract reported
  satisfied — and **self-test breakage 72, which performs exactly that deletion,
  was green.** This is the rule AGENTS.md already states about `-count=1` ("a
  check that a comment can satisfy is not a check") arriving in a new place, and
  the only reason it is written down here is that the self-test could not see it:
  the mutation was real, the recipe ran, and the check agreed with the tree.

  All three of the check's tests now read code with the comments stripped, per
  language — `//` for go/node/rust, `#` for python, and for elixir a `#` that is
  **not** `#{`, because interpolation is code and can carry a setting. The
  stripper does not track string literals, which is deliberate and conservative:
  a comment marker inside a string leaves its line scanned rather than eating the
  code after it, so the failure this can cause is a missed setting, never a
  setting wrongly reported absent.

  Fixing it also corrected `contract.json`'s bounded-pool token: it listed
  `:pool_size`, a spelling that existed only in the Elixir snippet's *prose*,
  while the code says `pool_size: @pool_size`. Once the comments stopped
  counting, the token read as absent and named a real defect in the token list.

- **`self_test.sh` classified a caught defect as a machine failure, on a large
  gate report.** The `env_skips` branch added in `1d98e42` tested for a finding
  with `printf '%s\n' "$out" | grep -qE '^(FAIL|SKIP)'` — while the verdict three
  lines above it had been changed to the non-piping `contains` for exactly this
  reason. **The fix was applied to one branch and missed in the one beside it.**

  The mechanism, measured: on a 239KB gate report whose findings sit at the top,
  that pipeline exits **141** *with the match present*. `grep -q` closes the pipe
  on its first match, `printf` dies of SIGPIPE, and `set -o pipefail` promotes 141
  to the pipeline's status — so the verdict flipped on the SIZE of the output
  rather than on what was in it. The threshold is a property of the pipe buffer,
  so it moves with the machine.

  And it fails in the worst direction available: the false answer is "this is an
  ENVIRONMENT failure", which is precisely the verdict that excuse was added to
  stop being lost. Four breakages — 71, and the three this packet adds (75, 76,
  77) — were reported as unevaluated on a run where every one of them had in fact
  been caught, and 72 was reported as "the gate stayed GREEN". Now a `contains`
  call, like its neighbours.

- **`fleet_check.py` no longer reported a clean fleet while five repositories
  carried their own Postgres.** `check_stale_copy` — failure mode 1, the check
  whose entire job is naming a service running its own copy of the shared
  platform — matched a service's image against kit's by **bare repository
  name**. kit-21 made the cluster a *built* image (MD21b), so kit's went from
  `postgres:${KIT_POSTGRES_TAG:-…}` to `kit-postgres:${…}`; a duplicating service
  still writes `postgres`, and the two stopped matching. Measured on the commit
  that shipped it:

  ```console
  $ fleet_check.py --repos-dir <a fleet whose alpha runs postgres:17>
  PASS fleet: no service carries a copy of kit's stack, none weakens the
               redaction boundary, no collector config is dead, …
  ```

  The comparison is now over the **upstream** image kit's stack is built *from*,
  not over the name of the local artefact kit built it into — a service cannot
  know to write `kit-postgres`, which is a build tag that exists on one
  developer's machine.

  It went unnoticed for a reason worth recording, because it is the same shape as
  the bug: self-test breakages 52/59/60 mutate a fixture to carry a stale copy
  **with a `ports:` entry**, and `check_override_surface` reports a published
  port by *service name* — a name the rename never touched. So breakage 60 went
  red on the port half while the image half was dead, and a green control was
  evidencing a different check. New **breakage 75** mutates the same fixture
  *without* the port, so the image comparison is the only thing that can go red;
  it is red on the pre-fix code and green on the post-fix code, both measured.

- **`bin/dev db grant` now exists.** Four files in this repository told a service
  author to run it — `templates/database/README.md`, `DECISIONS.md`,
  `templates/compose/postgres/initdb/10-cluster.sh` and
  `templates/compose/docker-compose.yml` — and `bin/dev` had no `db` command at
  all. Every one of those four is a reader who is told the way out of "my
  service's database was never created" exists, runs it, and gets
  `unknown command`. `DECISIONS.md` was created to stop this repository
  referencing a document that did not exist; this was the same defect one layer
  down, and it is now a check (**breakages 76 and 77**) rather than a fix, since
  the class is "a document names an interface and the interface disagrees".

  The command **prints** the statements and does not run them: they are
  `CREATE ROLE` and `CREATE DATABASE` on a cluster a service is about to be
  handed credentials for, and a wrapper whose failure mode is half-provisioned is
  not something to perform on a stack it did not start. It prints the
  `REVOKE ALL ON DATABASE … FROM PUBLIC` with them, which is the whole point —
  see the next entry.

- **the operator-side half of the isolation boundary is now stated rather than
  implied.** `DECISIONS.md` listed "the `REVOKE` for a database added by hand"
  among the things left to the operator, in one line, as a pointer to a command
  that did not exist. It now says what the position actually is: the boundary
  holds **by construction** for every database declared in
  `KIT_POSTGRES_DATABASES` on a fresh volume, and a database added afterwards is
  **the operator's to close** — because `docker-entrypoint-initdb.d` runs once per
  volume and cannot sweep a database that does not exist yet. A database created
  by hand and not revoked is reachable by every role in the cluster, whatever the
  table grants say. `tests/isolation_test.sh` proves the first half against a real
  cluster; the second is a documented step, and the document now says so where an
  adopter will read it.

### Changed

- **`templates/deploy/compose.deploy.yml`'s comment claimed its Postgres was "the
  same tag `templates/compose/docker-compose.yml` uses", so "a deploy and a
  `bin/dev up` are running the same database."** Both halves became false at
  kit-21: the dev stack moved to `postgres:17` because pgvector is a glibc-linked
  layer (MD21b), and the developer topology became one cluster of N databases
  rather than one database. The tag is unchanged and the deploy file is
  deliberately a *different* topology — one database for one service, with no
  initdb script, no per-service roles and no revoke, because there is nothing to
  isolate it from. The comment now says that, so the two are not "unified" by a
  reader in a hurry.

### Added

- **one Postgres cluster, one database and one role per service, and the database
  is the isolation boundary.** Nine services, one cluster, no pooler. A service
  adds its own name to `KIT_POSTGRES_DATABASES` and gets a role, a database and a
  refused-at-the-door boundary — there is no second container, no second port and
  no second volume, which is the entire point of sharing a cluster.

  `templates/compose/postgres/initdb/10-cluster.sh` provisions one non-superuser
  role and one owned database per name, then applies the boundary by **sweeping
  `REVOKE ALL ON DATABASE … FROM PUBLIC` over every non-template database** in
  the cluster rather than over a list of the ones it created. Measured, and this
  is the load-bearing part: with the revoke, `psql -U courier -d billing` answers
  `FATAL: permission denied for database "billing"` / `DETAIL: User does not have
  CONNECT privilege` before a query is parsed; without it, the connection
  **succeeds** and only the `SELECT` on billing's table is refused — by the
  accident that nobody granted it. A cluster provisioned without the revoke has,
  by Postgres's default, no isolation at all, and fails open silently.

- **`tests/isolation_test.sh` — the proof, not the claim.** Brings the *shipped*
  stack up through compose, creates two service databases and two service roles,
  and asserts service A cannot reach service B's, printing the refused query and
  the server's answer. Four assertions: A reaches its own; A is refused B's; B is
  refused A's (one lucky direction is not isolation); and a **control cluster of
  the same shape with the revoke removed must let A in**.

  The control is the assertion that makes the rest mean anything, and it is
  there because of the rule this repository already applies to allowlists and
  proofs: an assertion that cannot be shown to fail is not known to be
  load-bearing. Without it, a check asserting "A cannot SELECT from B's rows"
  would pass on a cluster with no isolation at all. Wired into the gate's
  observability phase with its own `BOUND` bound (1800s — three container
  lifecycles and two initdb runs), and a loud SKIP when docker is absent.

- **`templates/database/` — the connection contract, published and consumed.** The
  topology is only finished if a service's config actually works against it, so
  the four settings that only matter on a shared cluster are generated per
  language rather than described in a comment:

  | setting | what it prevents on one cluster |
  |---|---|
  | `application_name` | an unattributable query — nine services in one `pg_stat_activity` and no way to say whose |
  | `statement_timeout` | one service's runaway query occupying shared resources |
  | `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout` | one forgotten `BEGIN` blocking `VACUUM` cluster-wide |
  | a bounded pool | one service taking the connections the other eight need |

  Six languages (go, elixir, python, ruby, node — also bun — and rust), each
  parsed by **its own parser** in the gate, and each required to carry the
  contract by `templates/database/contract.json` rather than by a grep repeated
  six times. The cluster sets the two timeouts **per role** as a backstop, so a
  service that forgets them is bounded rather than unbounded.

- **the pooler decision, as a check rather than a paragraph.** kit runs **no
  PgBouncer**: direct connections, `max_connections` raised to 200, a per-role
  `CONNECTION LIMIT`, and per-role timeouts. The argument is in
  `templates/database/README.md` and the measurements in `DECISIONS.md` (MD21); the
  deciding sentence is from PgBouncer's own configuration documentation, which
  describes `RECONNECT` on its admin console as the remedy for
  `ERROR: cached plan must not change result type` after a DDL migration — a
  manual operator step after every schema change in nine repositories.

  The pooler workarounds are **forbidden** in `contract.json` and the gate fails
  the build if one appears in any generated config. A service carrying
  `prepare: :unnamed` on a fleet with no pooler is slower and looks entirely
  correct, so nothing else would ever find it.

- **`DECISIONS.md` — the file seven places referenced and that did not exist.**
  `AGENTS.md` (twice), `README.md` (twice, one of them a markdown link),
  `.github/zizmor.yml`, `ci.reusable.yml` (three times) and three of the gate's
  own scripts all pointed at it. A reference to a decision document that is not
  there tells the reader the trade was made and then leaves them with nothing to
  read — worse than not claiming it, because the absence looks like they have not
  looked hard enough. It now exists, with MD10, MD12, MD13 and the four MD21
  entries this packet decided, and a check asserts it is present, records real
  entries, and that every reference to it resolves.

### Changed

- **the cluster image is `postgres:17` (Debian), not `postgres:17-alpine`.**
  pglayers publishes each extension as a glibc-linked layer built from the PGDG
  Debian packages, and alpine is musl. Measured, on the alpine base: the image
  **builds cleanly** and then `CREATE EXTENSION vector` reports the extension is
  not available, with `ldd` showing `Error loading shared library
  ld-linux-*.so.1`. Two independent failures — the loader cannot resolve a glibc
  binary, and alpine's PostgreSQL looks under
  `/usr/local/share/postgresql/extension` while pglayers writes to
  `/usr/share/postgresql/17/extension`. On `postgres:17` the same layer answers a
  real query. An image that claims pgvector and does not have it is worse than one
  that is visibly missing it.

  The layer is composed rather than pulled: `pglayers-full` would be one line
  instead of four, but it *replaces* the official `postgres` image with a
  community build for every service permanently, and loads 80+ extensions and a
  raised `max_worker_processes` onto the cluster whether or not any is used.
  Trade recorded as MD21b, including that pglayers is a community project and
  **not** a PostgreSQL one — it layers onto the official images, which is a
  weaker claim.

- **extensions are a cluster decision, created by the admin role.** A service role
  cannot `CREATE EXTENSION`: pgvector's control file is not marked `trusted`, so
  a non-superuser is refused with `HINT: Must be superuser to create this
  extension`. Verified against pglayers' layer *and* upstream pgvector v0.8.6,
  whose `vector.control` is byte-identical — this is pgvector's own
  classification, not something the packaging drops. The `SET ROLE` design that
  looked right could not work, and the measurement is why.

- **`lint/hadolint.yaml` ignores DL3067 as well as DL3008.** The cluster image is
  `COPY --from=<layer> / /`, which is pglayers' whole mechanism and has no
  narrower form on PG17. The rule's rationale — an accidental whole-filesystem
  copy pastes in unreviewed files — is answered by pinning a specific published
  version of one extension rather than by the rule.

- **`templates/compose/.env.example` said `KIT_POSTGRES_TAG=16.6-alpine` while
  `docker-compose.yml` defaulted to `17-alpine`, and `.env.example` WINS** —
  `bin/dev` copies it to `.env` on first run, so every developer's stack ran 16.6
  while the compose file, this README and the CHANGELOG all said 17. Commit
  `48689e6` fixed the compose default and left the file that overrides it alone,
  which is the more dangerous half of that fix: it made the repository agree with
  itself and the developer's machine disagree with both.

  Now asserted in **both directions** — a tag in `.env.example` that is not the
  compose default fails, and a compose default that is not that tag fails. A
  check that only asked "is `KIT_POSTGRES_TAG` in `.env.example`" would be
  satisfied by the broken state, because the broken state has it. The check also
  refuses an alpine variant, with the reason. self_test breakage 68 is the shipped
  defect and breakage 69 is the alpine regression.

- **`artifacts.json` documented an `optional` field that no code implemented.**
  "Such an artefact is reported but does not, by itself, make a service look
  broken" — a property stated in the table's own `_about` and asserted in zero
  places, because no artefact in the table used it. kit-21 added the first
  optional artefacts and the reporter turned every one into an unpinned finding
  for every service in the fleet, which is the opposite of what the field says.
  `staleness.py` now implements it, and the exemption is **`absent` only**: a
  `diverged` optional artefact is a copy that has drifted and still needs a pin,
  and an `unknown` one is an unmeasured artefact and inherits the fail-closed
  rule rather than copying it.

### Fixed (previously open in this release)

- **a gate that exited non-zero reporting NO finding was reported as "the gate
  went red, but NOT via `<the named check>`", which blames a check for a machine
  problem.** `expect_red_check` had exactly two verdicts — green, or red-for-a-
  different-reason — and neither of them is true when the nested gate died before
  reporting anything: it is neither a proof the mutation escaped nor a proof the
  check failed to catch, it is a proof that could not be **evaluated**.

  It surfaced on kit-19's own full gate, at load average 15 on a 16GB box:
  breakage 35 came back `exit 1` with an empty finding list and was counted as a
  check that failed to catch a half-adopted language. `validate.sh` exits 1 on a
  FAIL *and* exits 1 from bootstrap when it cannot install its own dependencies
  (lines 132 and 3195), and the second never reaches a single check — so the two
  are indistinguishable from the exit status alone.

  A third verdict now exists, `SKIP`, and it is distinguished from a missing
  toolchain by a **separate counter** (`env_skips` against `skips`) because they
  are two different problems demanding two different responses. Both remain
  fatal: a proof nobody ran is not a proof, and an unevaluated one is not a proof
  either — but neither is reported as a gate defect, so the next reader does not
  go looking for a weakened check that is in fact fine. The summary names the
  count explicitly, because `env_skips` cannot appear in the PASS line at all
  (it is non-zero only on a run that exits 1).

  Verified against all four cases with the predicate isolated from the harness —
  a dead gate with no output classifies as an environment failure; a real red
  naming a *different* check still classifies as a red-for-the-wrong-reason; the
  named check firing is a pass; and green-with-no-finding is still a failure.
  That last one is the point: this widens what counts as an excuse by exactly the
  case where the gate said nothing, and no further.

  Same principle as breakage 39, which asserts the **explanation** rather than
  the exit status for the same reason: a red that misattributes itself sends the
  next reader to the wrong file.

- **`expect_green_check` read a MATCH as a non-match once the gate's output was
  large enough, so breakage 59 reported the adoption ceiling red when it had
  passed.** `printf '%s\n' "$out" | grep -qF` is the SIGPIPE defect
  `expect_red_check` was already repaired for and recorded at length: `grep -q`
  exits at the first match and closes the pipe, `printf` dies 141, `set -o
  pipefail` promotes that to the pipeline's status, and `!` inverts a success into
  a failure. It was latent because the gate's output had never crossed the 64K
  pipe buffer; kit-19's `license_check` printing its measurement on PASS — which
  is what `check`'s own contract asks of a check reporting which spec it
  verified — was the crossing point.

  Reproduced outside the suite to establish the mechanism rather than the
  coincidence: at 5000 lines `grep -qF` returns 141 and the shell `case` returns
  0 on the same input and the same match. The failing run printed the diagnosis
  itself — `printf: write error: Broken pipe` — inside a phase whose output nobody
  reads on a green run.

  **The fix is a `contains` helper** (a shell `case`, no pipe) used by
  `expect_red_check`, `expect_green_check` and `expect_skip_check`. Three correct
  copies were the wrong shape: the failure is a property of how the harness READS
  output and has nothing to do with which check it is reading. Stopping the new
  check printing was the alternative and it was worse twice over — it contradicts
  `check`'s documented behaviour, and the threshold it hides behind is a property
  of the pipe buffer, so it moves with the machine and returns as a flake on
  somebody else's packet. No recipe, threshold or pin changed.

- **`templates/compose/docker-compose.yml` defaulted to postgres 16.6 while the
  rest of the fleet floated at 17.** `postgres:${KIT_POSTGRES_TAG:-16.6-alpine}`
  meant a developer running `bin/dev` with nothing configured got postgres 16.6
  and a different database build from every CI runner in the fleet — which is the
  drift `core`'s `compose.postgres-pin` rule exists to make visible, and which
  it had recorded as a known exception since the rule landed.

  Now `postgres:${KIT_POSTGRES_TAG:-17-alpine}`, so an unconfigured developer
  gets the fleet's build. `core`'s recorded expectation in `tests/test_specs.py`
  and the table in `docs/postgres-pin.md` moved in the same commit as this one,
  because they are one claim stated twice.

  One kit reference to the rule remains and is now recorded rather than fixed:
  `templates/deploy/compose.deploy.yml` carries a `services.app.image` of
  `${KIT_DEPLOY_IMAGE:?the deploy tool sets KIT_DEPLOY_IMAGE}`. It is not a
  postgres image — it is a variable the deploy tool sets at run time — but it
  sits in `services:`, so the rule reads it. It is left visible on purpose:
  suppressing it would teach the rule to skip variables, and
  `${KIT_POSTGRES_TAG:-default}` is exactly the form the rule exists to resolve.

- **kit-17 — `templates/otel/ruby` had no interpreter floor, so the gate blamed
  the template for the interpreter it picked.** `FAIL templates/otel/ruby (ruby
  test suite)` on every gate run on macOS, minitest `.EE.......E..` — three of
  thirteen tests erroring, all three the same `NoMethodError: undefined method
  'filter_map'`, called from `usable_tracestate_entries`.

  **The template was right and the runner was wrong.** `filter_map` arrived in
  ruby 2.7; kit's own pin is 3.4 (`templates/mise.toml`, `lint/rubocop.yml`'s
  `TargetRubyVersion`), and the macOS system interpreter at `/usr/bin/ruby` is
  2.6.10. Every method *definition* in the file parses fine on 2.6, so 2.6 loads
  `traceparent.rb` without complaint and only raises on the first tracestate
  entry — which reads exactly like a bug in trace propagation, and was
  measured as one for three packets' worth of gate runs before anyone read a
  version number. (kit-14 attributed it pre-existing and reproduced it on a
  clean clone of master; this entry is the fix, not the attribution.) The other
  five templates are unaffected: go, node and rustc all *refuse* an old
  toolchain at build time with a message naming their own requirement. Ruby is
  the only one of the six that can fail silently.

  - **`KitOtel::RUBY_FLOOR = '2.7'`, in the file.** Not a sentence in the header,
    because the failure it prevents does not look like a version problem. 2.7 is
    `filter_map` and nothing else — everything else in the file and its suite is
    2.4 or older (`casecmp?` 2.4, `allbits?` 2.5, `&.` 2.3) — so it is the
    file's real requirement rather than a guess, and well below the 3.4 kit hands
    a service.
  - **The gate reads that constant** (`ruby_floor()`) instead of keeping its own
    copy of the number. A version restated in the runner is a second place for it
    to rot, and asking the artifact is the same reason the classifier's tier
    lives in `rules.json` and nowhere else.
  - **A below-floor interpreter is a loud, counted `SKIP`, not a `FAIL`.** The
    template is correct and the interpreter is too old; reporting that red would
    keep three landed-or-landing packets blocked by a red naming a file none of
    them touched. Reporting it `PASS` would be worse — a pass on the strength of
    thirteen tests that never ran. An unreadable floor is still a `FAIL`: that one
    *is* a template defect.
  - **`version_at_least()` — a hand-rolled version comparison.** Not `sort -V`,
    which is a GNU coreutils extension older BSD sort lacks; a floor comparison
    that degrades to a *string* compare on the sort macOS ships reads `2.10` <
    `2.9`. An unparseable field refuses rather than assuming the version is new
    enough — fail-closed, like `tests/classify.py`.
  - **Two new self-test breakages, 23 and 23b, both on a stub `ruby` that
    reports 2.6.10 and refuses the suite.** 23 deletes the floor guard and
    asserts the suite goes red *under its own label*; 23b keeps the guard and
    asserts the gate stays **green** while naming the skip. 23b needed a fourth
    helper, `expect_skip_check`: "the gate went red" cannot express a check that
    is load-bearing precisely by not going red, and "the gate went green" is
    satisfied just as well by a check that was deleted entirely.
  - **Two counting bugs found on the way, both the same shape.** The breakage
    counts in `self_test.sh` and `validate.sh` anchored on `^expect_`, which also
    matches the four helper *definitions* — `expect_red() {` looks exactly like a
    call to a name-only pattern — so both printed **28 over 23 recipes**. And the
    header/recipe check anchored on `^expect_` too, so the indented calls in
    breakages 23/23b (inside a `command -v ruby` guard) were reported as two
    documented breakages carrying no recipe: the check was right about the
    disagreement and wrong about the cause. All three now anchor on the breakage
    *label*, which a function definition cannot carry. `[ \t]*` rather than `\s*`
    in the header check, because under `re.M` `\s` matches a newline and `\s*`
    could span onto the next line and match a label that is not a recipe at all.
  - `self_test.sh` is now **25 breakages — 24 that assert the gate goes red, and
    one (23b) that asserts a green gate with a named skip.** The summary line
    says which is which rather than claiming all 25 "went red", because that
    would be a false statement about a proof that passed.

  Gate on this branch: **143 pass, 0 fail, 2 skip** (both the pre-existing
  `node --check cannot read TypeScript` skips for `templates/tier/{node,bun}`,
  which are a parser gap in a packet that owns it, not this one). All six
  traceparent suites green, `canary_test.sh` green against a real collector.


### Changed

- **kit-12 — lint runs from kit. The `cp` is gone.**
  `lint/` was 249 lines of golangci, rubocop, eslint, yamllint and hadolint
  configuration that **not one service in the fleet had ever copied**, and every
  check in this repository was green the whole time. Adoption correlated
  *inversely* with how much a file did: `uses: cafaye/kit/...@master` is 11/11
  because it is live, and `cp lint/golangci.yml` is 1/11 because a snapshot has
  no propagation and rots silently. So the config moved to where the step already
  is, and adoption becomes 11/11 with no per-service action.

  (The brief this packet answered put those at 8/8 and 0/9. The second is
  stale — `identity` has since landed a `.golangci.yml` of its own on `master`,
  for a reason recorded in `lint/drift-allowlist`. Writing `0/9` here would have
  been a number this work had measured and known to be wrong.)

  - **`kit-lint-ref` and a sparse `lint/` checkout, in the go, ruby and node
    jobs.** The workflow file and the configs are two different things:
    `uses: cafaye/kit/...@X` pins the *workflow*, and a reusable workflow is not
    handed its own ref — so the configs are fetched by name, and the name has to
    be an input. Pin it to the **same** ref you pinned `uses:` to; a caller who
    pins one and not the other gets that SHA's workflow with today's lint
    policy, which nothing detects automatically and is therefore documented in
    the input and in README.md rather than pretended to be automatic.
  - **The ESLint config is checked out *inside* the repository, at
    `<working-dir>/.kit`.** Measured, not preferred: node resolves an ESM import
    from the config file's own directory upward, so a config beside the
    repository finds no `@eslint/js` and the run dies with
    `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` — a red build that has linted nothing. One location
    serves all three linters.
  - **`lint/eslint.config.mjs` ignores `.kit/**`.** Without it the run is red
    with a parse error about *kit's own* config file, in a service that did
    nothing wrong, on a file the service never wrote.
  - **`lint-args` is the deviation seam**, and it is deliberately narrow: it is
    appended *after* kit's flags, so a service can add and cannot remove the
    `--config`; and it is a string rather than a path, so there is no
    service-side file to rot. What it may not do — change which config is read,
    what is linted, or whether a finding fails the build — is a list of 15
    refused flags enforced by a **`lint-args guard` step in the workflow**, not
    by kit's gate, because `lint-args` is the caller's value and kit has never
    got it. `lint_args_seam_check` asserts the guard is in all three lint jobs,
    that the copies are byte-identical, that it runs *before* the linter, and
    that its token list is the one written in the gate.
  - **ESLint runs directly, not `npm run lint`.** `npm run lint` is whatever
    script the repository happens to define — a repository that defines none gets
    a confusing "Missing script" rather than a lint, and one that defines it is
    running its own config, which is the copy this packet exists to end.

### Added

- **kit-19 — kit carries a licence, and a check that keeps it unambiguous.**
  cafaye's decision is MIT across the fleet, and `kit` had no `LICENSE` at all.
  That is not "unlicensed, therefore free": it is **all rights reserved**, the
  default copyright position when a public repository grants nothing, and it is
  the state `docs`' `licensing.md` names `kit` in. The grant is now the MIT text
  in `LICENSE`, and the README says so in two places — a `### kit's own licence`
  paragraph next to the AGPL one, and a `## License` section a reader looking for
  a licence actually finds.

  - **The check is for AGREEMENT, not for the file's existence, and that is the
    half that matters.** A licence is only unambiguous when exactly one place in
    a repository can declare one. `license_check` asserts the grant by MIT's own
    sentences rather than by the string `MIT` — the identifier is also how a
    badge line, a summary, or a note about some *other* repository's licence is
    spelled, and matching it passes on all three — asserts a copyright holder
    exists, asserts the README states MIT and links the file *in its own section*
    rather than anywhere in the document (the AGPL paragraph names a licence that
    is not kit's, so a whole-file substring search is satisfied by the exact
    conflation the section split exists to prevent), and then walks every root
    manifest that can carry a licence field and fails on any that is not MIT.

  - **It checks agreement, and does not ban the manifest.** A check satisfied by
    "kit has no `package.json`" would be satisfied by deleting one, and would be
    a `FAIL` the day kit legitimately grew one — the same shape as breakage
    31b's control. `templates/` is untouched by design: a licence in a template is
    that template's business, and only the root can be about kit.

  - **Two breakages, `61` and `62`, and 62 is the one that makes it real.** 61
    deletes `LICENSE`, which is the direction everybody can see. 62 writes a root
    `package.json` declaring `AGPL-3.0-only` while `LICENSE` and the README both
    still say MIT: the repository has acquired a third statement about its own
    grant, a compliance tool reads the manifest, and a reader has no way to tell
    which is authoritative. A check asserting only that `LICENSE` exists is
    satisfied by exactly that state, and a manifest is easy to add without
    anybody thinking of it as a licence decision. 62's fixture is **assembled**
    with `printf`, not written out — the same rule as breakages 24, 25 and 33,
    because a probe written out is a probe committed.

  - **`fresh_copy` now copies `LICENSE`.** Without it the new check fails on
    every throwaway copy for a reason that has nothing to do with the defect
    under test, and the two green-expecting proofs (23b, 59) go red for that
    reason. A check that cannot run in a copy is a proof that proves nothing
    while reporting something.

  - **Two counts moved, both in prose rather than in code.** The self-test is
    now 67 breakages, 65 of which must go red, and 47 assert the *named* check.
    `self_test.sh`'s header is checked against the recipes by
    `self_test_claims`, so the header could not simply be left at sixty-five; the
    README and `AGENTS.md` prose is not mechanically checked, which is why it is
    worth saying the numbers were updated in all three places deliberately.

- **kit-13 — the observability stack gets a live path, and a gate that says which
  repositories are not on it.** `templates/compose/` shipped a complete local
  observability platform and **no service used it**: no repository had an
  `otel-collector.yml`, six carried a bespoke 52–158 line
  `docker-compose.yml` whose only infrastructure was a Postgres, and **none**
  adopted `bin/dev`. The stack was built, gated, and running nowhere.

  - **`bin/dev` fetches the stack from a PINNED kit ref** and runs it beside the
    service's own `docker-compose.yml`, which is an override. A compose file
    cannot be `uses:`-ed — GitHub resolves reusable *workflows* and nothing else —
    so `bin/dev` is the callable path and the pin is what makes it one.
    `git init` + `fetch --depth 1` rather than `clone --branch`, because
    `--branch` cannot take a commit sha and so cannot express the stricter of the
    two pin forms.

  - **The pin is `kit.ref`, a committed one-liner — and it was `.env` first.**
    `.env` is git-ignored, so a pin there exists on exactly one machine and on no
    CI runner or teammate's checkout, which turns "one command, always current"
    into "one command, whatever this checkout last fetched". `bin/dev pin <ref>`
    moves it deliberately and prints the stack diff first. A 40-char sha or a
    `v<semver>` tag; a branch is refused **before any network call**, because by
    the time a fetch has returned it has already changed under you.

  - **`KIT_STACK_OFFLINE=1` is a real mode.** It uses only `KIT_STACK_DIR`, the
    cache, or a copy vendored at `.kit/stack` — and fails loudly, naming each,
    when none holds the pin. A cached or vendored tree must RECORD its ref in
    `.kit-stack-ref`; a directory that merely contains `templates/compose/` is
    refused, because accepting one silently is how an offline loop stops matching
    what the team runs.

  - **`tests/fetch_test.sh`** — 14 assertions, executed. A pinned ref resolves and
    the fetched bytes are byte-identical to the tree; a branch, a short sha and
    an empty pin are each refused with a message that says why; offline runs from
    a cache with the remote deleted from disk, fails loudly with a cold one, and
    accepts or refuses a vendored copy by whether it declares the pin. The remote
    is a local `file://` bare repository built from this tree, so the suite needs
    no network.

  - **`tests/stack_live_test.sh`** — 15 assertions, executed, and the reason the
    packet is not "a compose file that parses". It brings the **fetched** stack up
    (all eight containers healthy), sends real OTLP, and reads a trace out of
    Tempo and a metric out of Mimir — including the `spanmetrics` connector's
    `cafaye_duration_count`, which is what the fleet dashboard is built on. The
    canary reaches no exporter, asserted as an absence against a search that first
    proved the data is there. The collector's config is checked by
    `docker inspect .Mounts`: the daemon's own record of the bind, not the host's
    idea of it and not the container's (the image is distroless).

  - **`tests/fleet_check.py`, wired into the gate as `fleet`.** Four failure
    modes, one check each: a service carrying a copy of the shared stack, a
    service that re-points the collector's config mount (the redaction allowlist,
    derived from core's schemas), an `otel-collector.yml` nothing ever mounts, and
    a pin that is a branch. It reads the **sibling repositories**, not kit's own
    files, because the defect is in the callers — the same shape as D4.
    **It is red against the current fleet and that is the deliverable**: five
    repositories carry their own copy of the shared stack, six have no pin, and
    two publish a port on a service kit already ships. The predicate is the
    image, not the service name, and the image set is read out of kit's own
    compose file rather than a hand-kept list — three of the five copies name
    their database `db` rather than `postgres`, so a name-keyed check would report
    the fleet clean while five copies stood right there.

  - **Nine breakages (52–60), eight asserting the NAMED check and one asserting
    the gate stays green while naming its finding.** The fleet ones run against a
    **fixture fleet** rather than the real one — which is what makes the
    assertion mean anything when the real fleet is red by design. Breakage 58
    covers the `ports:` append rule and carries **no `image:`**, so it fires the
    port rule alone: a breakage that reddened two rules at once would not say
    which of them is load-bearing. 59 and 60 are the adoption ceiling's two
    sides and are described below.

- **kit-14 — the staleness reporter, pointed at `templates/`, and the word
  `absent`.**
  kit already had a change classifier and a staleness reporter for `core/`, and
  both work. Both also **only watched `core/`**, while `templates/` — the
  directory that has drifted furthest — was watched by nothing.

  This is not "detect drift in `templates/`". Drift detection assumes a copy
  exists, and in the fleet the copies are gone: of the twelve files in
  `templates/compose/`, the nine services hold `docker-compose.yml` in seven of
  them and **none of the collector, Tempo, Loki, Mimir or Grafana provisioning
  in any of them**. A reporter that only knew `current` and `stale` would have
  nothing to say about the commonest state in the fleet.

  - **`tests/artifacts.json` — the one place kit says what it ships and where a
    service puts it.** Twelve artefacts, the language each applies to, and the
    `compose` bundle's twelve members. Read by the reporter *and* by the gate,
    because a table written down twice is a table that is right in one of the
    two places. `destAlternatives` records the six Dockerfiles that live at the
    repository root rather than at kit's documented `docker/Dockerfile`: a
    documented, working placement is not an absence, and a reporter that cries
    wolf over it is a reporter that gets muted.
  - **`tests/staleness.py --scope templates` — five states.**
    `current`, `diverged`, **`absent`**, `unknown`, and `n/a`. `absent` is the
    new word and the whole reason the packet existed. `unknown` inherits the
    classifier's fail-closed rule rather than copying it: no declared language,
    a symlink where a copy should be, an unreadable file, an artefact kit has
    stopped shipping — each is a finding, because the cheap answer in every one
    of those cases is a guess. `n/a` exists so `unknown` can stay honest; a Go
    service has no `.rubocop.yml` because it is not a Ruby service, and calling
    that unmeasured would put three permanent, unfixable findings on every
    service in the fleet.
  - **A copy is never inferred from its content.** No similarity threshold, no
    percentage, no search for a file that hashes to kit's. A copy is `current`
    when the bytes at the declared path are equal and the path is a real file
    in the service's own tree, and at no other time. Proved by
    `tests/self_test.sh` breakage 37, written as the `quick_ratio() > 0.99`
    patch somebody would write to relax it.
  - **`templates/parity-allowlist` — why a copy is not kit's bytes.** The tier
    skip-allowlist's four hygiene rules in the same words and the same one-line
    dialect, because kit does not have two dialects of "record why". It adds the
    rule the tier file does not need: **an unpinned divergence or absence is a
    failure**, since its entries name copies in repositories the gate cannot
    read, and a record that silently omits a cell reads as "handled". **80
    entries**, and the count is printed on every green run because 80 is a bad
    number and everybody should be able to see that it is one.
  - **Eight new self-test breakages (33–40) and a boundary that finally has a
    check behind it.** 33 is a dead ledger entry (the ESLint shape) and 34 is an
    **expired** one — the first time anything in kit has watched a ratchet fire
    rather than reading that it exists, and it took spending a recipe to find
    that out. 35 is a `{lang}` source kit offers but does not ship: half a
    language is worse than none. 36 reports an `absent` artefact as `current`,
    and 37 grades by resemblance; they are separate because they are opposite
    mistakes, one removing a finding and the other inventing one, and a gate
    that can only do one of them is half a gate. 38 gives one of the two
    programs a third-party import, 39 removes a fixture's `.git` so the
    reporter cannot see it (and asserts the EXPLANATION, not just the exit
    status), and 40 deletes the line that consults the ruby toolchain floor.
  - **Two of those recipes were wrong, and `self_test` is what said so.**
    33 named an artefact id `artifacts.json` really declares, so the mutation
    broke nothing; the recipe now asserts its own premise before it mutates.
    34 asserted that the GATE rejects an entry naming a repository that is not
    on disk — it cannot, because kit's CI has no sibling checkouts and no gate
    here knows which repositories exist. The reporter does know, and
    `staleness_test.sh` proves that case; so 34 was re-pointed at the expiry
    rule the gate really has, rather than kit gaining a fleet roster so the
    gate could answer a question nobody asked it.
  - **`carve-out boundary` — a check, and the sentence it found out of date.**
    `AGENTS.md` has said "standard library only" since the carve-out was made
    and nothing verified it. The new check walks the **AST** of both programs —
    so a function-local import is read the same as a top-level one — and asserts
    that every module it finds is named in the sentence as well as on the list.
    It failed on its first run: `glob` arrived with this packet and `urllib` had
    been imported all along without ever being written down.

- **`tests/staleness.py --scope templates` measured the fleet, and the brief's
  numbers did not survive it.** `README.md` opens
  [what the fleet actually adopted](#what-the-fleet-actually-adopted) with the
  result. The corrections worth stating here: `mise.toml` is 9/9 diverged and
  the divergence is **adoption working**, because the template is the union of
  every language's pins (19 tools) and a service keeps the two it needs;
  `AGENTS.md` is 9/9 diverged and the divergence is the **opposite** — the
  template was superseded, only 12–40 of its 121 lines survive per service, and
  `## Observability` survives in **none** of the nine; and
  `lint/*` is **3 diverged, 3 absent**, not 0/9, because `billing`, `parlor` and
  `identity` each hold a linter config that is their own — none carrying kit's
  STRICTNESS NOTES block. The honest sentence is "nobody lints with kit's
  rules", not "nobody lints".

- **Four numbers in my own first draft were wrong, and all four flattered the
  measurement.** They are corrected above, in `templates/parity-allowlist` and
  in the report, and they are written down here because the pattern is the
  point: a figure that cannot survive being recomputed is a liability in a file
  whose whole job is to be believed.
  - **`AGENTS.md` "8–19 lines with markdown comments stripped".** The template
    has no comments to strip, and normalising the `<...>` placeholders does not
    shrink the diff either — still 315–669 changed lines. The nine are not
    filled-in forms, and this is the artefact where the fleet has the **least**
    of kit's template.
  - **`mise.toml` "8–19 code lines apart".** Not a number this comparison
    produces; the real figure is 80–110, and legitimately so.
  - **`bin/prime` "32 to 63 lines", and "the fleet's versions begin `#!/bin/sh`".**
    The range is 12–58. Only `caf` and `courier` use that shebang; `darkroom`,
    `muse` and `parlor` use kit's own, and **`identity/bin/prime` has no shebang
    at all**. All seven reasons asserted it; it was true for two. `billing`'s
    is not stale either — it carries the STRICTNESS NOTES block and is 12 lines
    from kit's ruby template, with Rails commands added.
  - **`billing/bin/dev` "predates kit's observability profile, brings up postgres
    and nats only".** It is two lines: `#!/usr/bin/env ruby` and
    `exec "./bin/rails", "server", *ARGV`. A Rails server shim, not a copy of
    kit's loop in any era. The claim was inferred from a line count rather than
    read off the file.

- **One of my own sentences was wrong, which is why it is here.** The first draft
  of `REPORT-kit-14.md` and of eight ledger entries said a partially-adopted
  compose stack "cannot start". Checked with `docker compose config`: it does
  not. None of the six services' compose files mounts any of kit's stack files,
  each declares one or two services of its own, and five of six pass validation
  — they are **replacements that kept a filename**, not broken copies. The
  reporter now says what it measured ("partially adopted: N of 12 members
  held") and stops there, because comparing bytes cannot tell a replacement from
  a broken copy.

- **A defect the byte-comparison cannot see, found while checking the sentence
  above.** `muse/docker-compose.yml` **does not parse**: an unquoted
  `${MUSE_VAULT_KEY:?…, or run: …}` whose error message contains a colon, and
  YAML reads the value as the start of a mapping. `docker compose config` fails
  with `yaml: line 65, column 67`. The reporter calls that cell `diverged`,
  which is true and is not the interesting thing about it; the ledger entry for
  `muse` now says so.

- **kit-16 — the first deployment, and the shape the other eight copy.**
  Nine services, nine languages, nine green gates, and not one of them had ever
  been deployed: there was no `deploy/` or `infra/` directory anywhere in the
  organisation and no ruling that mentioned production deployment. This is one
  reference deployment, run end to end, with the differences between the nine
  runtimes tabled rather than papered over.

  - **`templates/deploy/` — the distribution shape.** `compose.deploy.yml` is a
    real, runnable file rather than a template with holes in it: every value is
    a compose substitution, so it runs once `SERVICE_NAME` and
    `KIT_DEPLOY_IMAGE` are set. No `build:` section, `restart: unless-stopped`
    on every service, a healthcheck on every service, and **no credential
    anywhere in the file** — which is the property that shapes everything else.

  - **`templates/bin/deploy.sh` — the tool**, beside `dev.sh`, the other script
    kit hands out. `up` / `verify` / `rollback` / `status` / `down`. A deploy
    does not report success until the container's own healthcheck says
    `healthy`; a deploy that cannot reach green **rolls itself back** rather
    than leaving a broken version quietly replacing a working one.

  - **Credentials arrive on an inherited file descriptor and nowhere else.**
    There is no `--secrets-file`; `deploy` refuses the option by name. Values
    go into a **tmpfs** (RAM, per container, destroyed with the container)
    through the container's own stdin, so they never appear in `docker
    inspect`, in `docker compose config`, on the host disk, or in the image.
    The container starts and the application does not: `entrypoint.sh` waits
    for `/run/secrets/.loaded`, which the tool creates only once every claimed
    secret is in place, and **exits non-zero if it never arrives**.

  - **`templates/deploy/redact.py` — the log redactor.** Everything the tool
    prints is filtered: `docker inspect`, `docker compose config`, migration
    output, the health gate's own messages. Two layers — the exact values it
    was given, and **shape** (JWT, bearer token, AWS key, provider key, GitHub
    token, connection URL with a password, PEM header, any `*password*`/
    `*secret*`/`*token*` assignment) — because a filter that only knows its own
    inputs is defeated by anything it did not already hold. The credential's
    *name* survives, so the log still says which one was in play.

  - **`templates/deploy/reference/courier.deploy.yml` — the reference
    deployment**, and the thing this packet actually ran. `courier` (Elixir/
    Phoenix, 535 tests at `35c6a27`) was chosen over `caf` deliberately: it
    already has a release build and a readiness endpoint that really checks
    its database, so the template is written against the best story in the
    fleet rather than the worst. `caf` was rejected because a bug in its deploy
    path carries the authority to destroy shared Docker state.

  - **Rollback that is demonstrated, not described.** The previous artifact is
    recorded in a ledger (image tags and digests only — no secrets) *before*
    the new container starts, and `deploy rollback` runs the same deploy code
    path with a different tag and the same health gate.

  - **`tests/deploy_test.sh` — 66 assertions in nine sections, no sleeps.**
    Every health gate is demonstrated red **and** green: the database is taken
    away underneath the running service (`docker pause`, not `stop` — stopping
    the container destroys its tmpfs, so restarting it brings the database back
    *without its password* and tests the wrong thing), and `/readyz` is watched
    going 503, the container healthcheck is watched going unhealthy, and
    `deploy verify` is watched exiting non-zero; then all three are watched
    coming back. `/healthz` is asserted to stay 200 throughout, because a
    liveness probe that fails on a dependency turns a database blip into a
    crash-restart loop. The leak audit runs last, against the accumulated
    deploy log, the rendered compose config and `docker inspect`, and asserts
    the secret is present in the container's tmpfs so the negatives are real
    negatives.

    Two further sections close claims that would otherwise rest on reading the
    source. One deploys a **deliberately broken artifact** — the good image minus
    `/app/bin/migrate`, so the two differ by exactly the thing under test — and
    requires the deploy to report failure, to say it is rolling back, and to
    leave the previous artifact serving. The other creates a **decoy container
    and volume outside the compose project** and requires both to survive `down`
    *and* `down --purge`, so "never touch state you do not own" is executed
    rather than grepped for; it goes red if `cmd_down` ever grows a prune.

    **13 static proofs run without Docker; the 53 live ones SKIP loudly when the
    daemon or the image is absent, never silently.**

  - **The polyglot table, and why it is a table.** `docker/Dockerfile.go` and
    `docker/Dockerfile.rust` are `gcr.io/distroless/static` — **no shell, no
    coreutils** — so a shell-script secret gate cannot be mounted into them at
    all. The tool asks the container rather than the operator and switches to
    a tar streamed over `docker cp` when there is no shell, with the `.loaded`
    barrier as an extra tar member so a distroless service gets the identical
    guarantee; measured end to end against a distroless image carrying one bare
    binary and deliberately no `/bin/sh`. Separately, a `curl` healthcheck needs
    `curl`, and **the `-slim` runtimes ship neither `curl` nor `wget`** — a
    shell they do have, measured on `python:3.13-slim`. So each service writes
    its healthcheck in its own runtime's HTTP client, or, for distroless, in
    exec-form against a `healthcheck` subcommand the service itself provides.
    Migrations are a per-service label rather than a rule, because
    `bin/rails db:migrate`, `manage.py migrate` and `/app/bin/migrate` have no
    common form and Go and Rust have no schema at all.

  - **The database is pinned `postgres:17-alpine`**, the fleet's standard tag and
    the one `templates/compose/docker-compose.yml` already uses, so a deploy and
    a `bin/dev up` run the same server. Measured rather than assumed: `/bin/sh`
    (busybox), `pg_isready`, uid 0 and `docker-entrypoint.sh` on `PATH` — and no
    `curl`, with `wget` present, which is why the database's health probe is
    `pg_isready` and not an HTTP fetch. It runs behind the same secret gate as
    the application, because a `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` in `environment:` is a
    password `docker inspect` prints.

- **kit-15 — a check that fails when an adopting repository carries a workaround
  for a fixed core defect.** `core`'s gate checker had two defects that forced
  repositories which adopted `gate.yml` into local workarounds: **D12**
  (`RUN_KEY` could not see a one-line `run:`, fixed in core `63fd319`) and
  **D13** (a proof matched against bytes still carrying ANSI colour, fixed in
  core `c63af27`). Both are fixed, and a workaround for a fixed defect is not
  neutral — it is a second, local, unpolicied copy of a decision that now lives
  in core, and it is the kind that rots. A `gate.yml` carrying a hand-rolled
  escape-tolerant regex is now **weaker** than one without it: the escape runs
  absorb characters a stricter pattern would have rejected.

  - **`tests/gate_declaration_check.py`** — sweeps the adopting repositories for
    three shapes, each of which is *structural* rather than a keyword: a
    `proof[].match` carrying an escape token (D13), a `run:` block scalar whose
    entire body is the declared argv and nothing else (D12), and a comment
    naming a checker-internal term while claiming a `run:` spelling the checker
    cannot see (D12). It does **not** prescribe a `run:` spelling — doing that
    would be a second copy of a decision core owns, and `courier`'s block scalar
    is correct for three real reasons.
  - Wired into `tests/validate.sh` as `adopting repositories (no workaround for
    a fixed core defect)`, with the fleet root discovered beside the repository
    and a reported SKIP when there is none — the same treatment the
    core-allowlist check already gets, for the same reason.
  - **Three breakages in `tests/self_test.sh` (24-26)**, over a synthetic fleet
    built in the work directory, because kit is one repository and the fleet is
    fifteen. All three name the check they expect to go red, and the control is
    now the check's *positive* case: a sweep that has only ever run against a
    red fleet has proved it can fail and nothing about whether it is right.
  - `cafaye-rb`'s primary checkout is **red on this check today**, which is the
    check working: it carries the D12 workaround and the comment justifying it.
    It is fixed on `worker/kit-15-restore` and this is the report's evidence
    that the sweep found it.

  **The first version of the checker was a keyword scan and it cried wolf** —
  4 repositories, 24 findings, nearly all false, including `core/gate.yml` for
  the sentence "That is MD12's collect-then-run machinery" (`D12` is a substring
  of `MD12`) and `caf`'s declaration for comments arguing that a workaround is
  now *unnecessary*. Both fixes came from reading every comment it flagged, and
  both narrowed the check rather than loosening it. A check that fires on
  correct work teaches the reader to ignore it, and it had taught on the first
  repository scanned.

- **kit-12 — the gate now knows whether a linter ran.**
  - **`tests/lint_test.sh` (a sixth phase, `lint`, deliberately outside the
    `RUN_STATIC` guard).** Four linters are **executed** against a throwaway
    service built to violate exactly one rule, with kit's config, each paired
    with a control that must answer differently. `lint/` spent its whole life
    behind a parse check — `yaml.safe_load` on `golangci.yml`, `node --check` on
    the eslint config — and both are green on a file no linter has ever been
    pointed at. This phase is the only thing that tells a working config from a
    valid one, and it is **fatal on a skip**: the claim under test is "kit's
    configs work", and a run in which no linter executed has not tested it.
  - **`lint drift`, which reads BOTH files and reports the DIFFERENCE.** A
    service carrying a `.golangci.yml` that disagrees with kit's is told which
    linters it dropped or added. Banning the file was the first version and it is
    worse than the drift: a config that agrees with kit's has reached the same
    policy by another route, and failing it teaches the lesson that kit's config
    is a thing you get shouted at for having. Self-test breakage 31b asserts the
    agreeing copy **passes**, so the check cannot be satisfied by deleting it.
  - **`lint/drift-allowlist`**, for a difference that cannot be deleted yet:
    reason, owner, `since`, `until`, and four rules of which the fourth is the
    load-bearing one — **an entry that no longer describes a real difference
    fails**, modelled on ESLint's `reportUnusedDisableDirectives`. One entry is
    live: `identity`, whose `.golangci.yml` enables no linter and exists only to
    exclude one generated file.

### Fixed

- **A promise this repository made in a comment, with no control behind it.**
  The `lint-args` input's own description said `lint_wiring_check` "fails on
  exactly that string" for `--no-config`, and `lint_wiring_check` had no such
  assertion anywhere in it. The reason it *could* not have one is worth
  recording: `lint-args` is the **caller's** value, and kit's gate never sees
  it. So the control moved to where the value is — a `lint-args guard` step in
  every lint job — and kit's gate now asserts the guard exists, is identical in
  all three jobs, runs before the linter, is handed the variable, and still
  refuses all 15 flags. A comment promising a check is worse than no comment:
  the second one stops the reader looking for the first.
- **A claim this repository made about golangci-lint, before running it.** The
  drift check was written on the belief that a repo-root `.golangci.yml` is
  discovered "ahead of any flag the workflow passes", so a stale copy silently
  hijacked CI. **That is backwards.** `golangci-lint run -v` prints exactly one
  `[config_reader] Used config file`, and with `--config` it names kit's; a local
  config that disables `misspell` does not survive it, and RuboCop agrees. A copy
  does not hijack the build — it **splits** the policy, because every other
  invocation in that repository reads it while CI reads kit's, and it becomes
  live again the instant the flag is lost. That is still a finding, and it is the
  honest one. `GOLANGCI_LINT_CONFIG` **is** confirmed unread in v2, as claimed.
- **An allowlist rule that was red on a correct tree.** "An entry that no longer
  describes a difference" treated a repository that was *not in this checkout's
  fleet* as one that had stopped differing, so every run on a copy of kit — which
  is what `self_test.sh` does, twenty-odd times — reported the whole allowlist as
  dead. The rule is now scoped to repositories the run actually looked at; an
  entry naming one that was not looked at is reported as **unverified**, which is
  neither a pass nor a failure.


- **kit-08 — kit-04 landed on a master that had moved, without losing a check
  or a number.** `worker/kit-04` (secrets: gitleaks over full history, a
  runtime-leak canary, zizmor) branched before kit-05 and kit-07 and renumbered
  its breakages from the same base of 18 that master did. A textual union of the
  two files carries **34 recipes with four labels used twice** — 19, 20, 21 and
  22 — and `self_test_claims` compares the documented set against the carried
  set *as sets*, so the duplicates collapse silently and the check reports an
  agreement that does not exist.
  - Master's numbering is canonical and did not move. kit-04's **six language
    mutants** were dropped, not renumbered: they are master's 13–18 byte for
    byte, and a second copy would prove the same six rules twice under two
    names. kit-04's **eleven unique breakages** moved to **41–51**.
  - `tests/validate.sh`: 45 check sites on master, 34 on kit-04, **59
    merged** — twenty of the sites are shared verbatim, which is why the union is
    less than the sum. Both sides' checks survive, and what proves it is the
    *label* set rather than the count: every label on either side is still present
    in the merged file, except two that were resolved deliberately —
    `collector_check`, which is one function whose label disagreed (master's
    fuller revision won) and whose kit-04 version was an earlier, smaller copy of
    the same function; and the `self_test` invocation site itself, which is the
    union documented below.
    Master's `collector_check` also *subsumes* the part of kit-04's that is not
    superseded: `receivers` and `batch` are asserted per signal rather than for
    `traces` alone. The rest is deliberately gone — kit-04's "the traces pipeline
    ships to no non-local exporter" described the pre-fan-out stack, whose only
    exporter was `debug`, and it would go red against the tempo/loki/mimir
    fan-out master now ships. Keeping it would have been a check that fails on a
    correct tree, which is worse than no check.
  - The `self_test` invocation site now takes the union of both: `check_verbose`
    (kit-04's — the list of breakages that went red *is* the evidence, and a
    plain `check` prints one line and throws the rest away) with master's
    counted label. The count is `grep`-derived in both files from the same
    expression.
  - One mechanism replaced two: `self_test.sh` had a runtime `breakages=$((…))`
    counter *and* the grep. The counter also decremented itself on a skipped
    language, so a machine missing a toolchain would print a *lower* total than
    the file contains — which reads as though proofs had been dropped rather
    than as a missing prerequisite.
  - **The renumbering was left in two visible states, and both are fixed here.**
    The recipes ran `1`–`18`, then `41`–`51`, then `19`–`22`, so the file did not
    read in the order its own header documents it. Recipes `19`–`22` now sit
    between `18` and `41`, and the file runs in label order.
  - **`41`–`51` no longer share variable names with `19`–`22`.** The renumber
    rewrote the labels and left the variable names behind, so breakage `47` was
    still called `nineteen`; master's `19`–`22` then bound those same four names
    to a second directory. It worked only because each was read before the next
    write. Those eleven variables are now named for what they break.
  - **There is no breakage 23, and it was never a lost recipe.** The block moved
    by `+11`, carrying kit-04's `23` — the zizmor `unpinned-uses` baseline — to
    `51`. The gap is now documented where a renumber script will read it as a
    bug, and README states the scheme.

### Fixed

- **The gitleaks gate was red on kit-16's JWT canary, and the allowlist was empty
  by design.** `.gitleaks.toml` carried no `[[allowlists]]` entry because kit's own
  history scanned clean — but the gate runs `git log --all`, and every worker in
  this fleet is a worktree of one shared repository, so `--all` reaches
  `worker/kit-16-deploy`'s commit `924b725`: a `jwt` finding on
  `tests/deploy_test.sh` line 155. It is a fixture. kit-16's deploy story proves
  the redactor scrubs a token the deploy never supplied, and a canary built from a
  name the filter already knows would prove nothing — so the token is committed
  and the `jwt` rule fires on it. **The scanner did the one thing it is for.**
  The entry is the narrowest the config format allows — `targetRules = ["jwt"]`
  with `paths = ['''^tests/deploy_test\.sh$''']`, and `condition = "AND"`
  written out rather than left to the default, which is **OR**
  (`config/config.go`, `parseAllowlist`: an empty `condition` maps to
  `AllowlistMatchOr`) and would silently make the entry a union the day somebody
  adds a second criterion. Measured in a throwaway repository, both directions: a
  `jwt` in that file is suppressed, while a `generic-api-key` in the **same file**
  and a `jwt` in a **different file** are both still reported.
  - **The canary was re-proved after the entry was added**, because allowlisting a
    canary is only honest if the canary can still fail. `redact.py`'s JWT pattern
    weakened from `\.[A-Za-z0-9_-]{4,}` to `{99,}` in a scratch export of
    `worker/kit-16-deploy`, and `tests/deploy_test.sh` went red on **exactly one**
    claim — "the redactor left a JWT in the output" — with its other 16 green.
    Reverted, and the scratch copy is byte-identical to the branch.
  - **The better fix is kit-16's, and it is recorded as such.** The canary could
    be assembled at run time from a prefix, the way `templates/secrets/` already
    does, which is the pattern that exists so this file never needs an entry. That
    branch is not merged here. The entry is written so it decays: if kit-16 stops
    committing the string it matches nothing, and the next reader deletes it.
  - **The scan was not narrowed.** `--all` is what catches a secret that only ever
    existed on a branch, and it is the reason this finding was ever visible: on a
    single-branch clone the canary is invisible and the gate is green.
  - **README now says to delete the entry when copying the file.** kit's config is
    copied verbatim into thirteen repositories, and this entry names
    `tests/deploy_test.sh`, which none of them has. A `paths` allowlist matching
    nothing excuses nothing, so it cannot weaken a service's scan — but an entry
    whose reason is only true of the repository it came from is how the next reader
    learns that descriptions are optional in practice. gitleaks cannot report a
    dead allowlist entry the way `templates/tier/skip-allowlist` reports a dead one
    there, so the obligation is the reader's, and the README is the only place it
    can be stated.
- **`templates/otel/ruby` is red on master, and this merge neither caused nor
  fixed it.** Three `NoMethodError`s for `Array#filter_map` (Ruby 2.7+,
  `traceparent.rb:278`) under `/usr/bin/ruby` 2.6.10. Re-derived rather than
  inherited: `run_ruby` is byte-identical to master's, `git diff master --
  templates/otel/ruby/` is empty, and `git archive master` into a clean directory
  reproduces `3 errors` with master's own template and master's own runner —
  while the pinned `ruby 4.0.1` gives `1407 assertions, 0 errors`. The
  1370-vs-1407 gap is the tell: an interpreter too old to define a method does not
  skip assertions, it aborts the three tests that reach it. kit-14 has the real fix
  on `worker/kit-14-stale` (a `toolchain_floor_ruby` feature probe that FAILs
  naming the toolchain, proven by its breakage 30 — which is **breakage 40** on
  this branch); that branch was not merged when this was written.
  Not fixed here: it is pre-existing, it does not reproduce on this box's `PATH`,
  and a fix for a red I cannot see is a change I cannot verify. Rewriting
  `traceparent.rb` to avoid `filter_map` is recorded as the fix that is not the fix
  — it makes the gate green on an old interpreter by removing what the suite
  exists to exercise.
- **`expect_red_check` reported a proof as failing when the check it named was
  the one that fired.** The matcher was `printf '%s\n' "$out" | grep -qF`, and
  under `set -o pipefail` a writer that takes SIGPIPE makes the whole pipeline
  non-zero — so `grep -q` exiting at its first match turned a **hit** into a
  miss. Deterministic on output size, not on load: below the 64KB pipe buffer the
  assertion is correct, at or above it, `printf` is killed mid-write. Breakages
  **11** (hadolint) and **42** (the working-tree credential) both exceed it and
  were both reported as *"the gate went red, but NOT via `<the check that fired>`"*
  while printing that check among the FAIL lines it had just proven present.
  Now a substring test on the already-captured `$out`: no pipe, no SIGPIPE, and
  the assertion no longer depends on how much the gate prints. The same defect
  and the same answer were already recorded in `tests/canary_test.sh` for
  `docker logs | grep -q`.
- `tests/validate.sh` and `templates/secrets/go/sweep.go` cited breakages by their
  **kit-04** numbers — `15` for the `--redact` removal (now `43`) and `21` for the
  marshalling canary (now `49`). Both are the renumber's fallout, and both
  pointed a reader at the wrong recipe.
- Count drift in the prose, all of it second-hand rather than measured: `AGENTS.md`
  said *twenty-three* breakages in one place and *thirty-four* in another, *eight*
  named checks against the real **nineteen** (+2 over proof scripts = twenty-one),
  and *nineteen ways* in its own pre-commit checklist. `README.md` and
  `tests/self_test.sh` both counted the named proofs as *twenty* against the
  **nineteen** their own lists enumerate. Every one of these is a copy of the
  truth taken by hand, which is the failure the derived count exists to prevent.
- `tests/self_test.sh`'s header described the thirty-four breakages as *18 from
  the fan-out work, 17 from the tier work, 11 from the secrets work, 12 shared* —
  58, for a file that carries 34.
- A section comment read `# 47-22.` where the canary vectors are `47`–`50`: the
  renumber script's arithmetic leaking into prose.
- **Two of the thirty-four proofs were dead, and the renumber is what killed
  them.** Giving breakages `41`–`51` descriptive directory names named breakage
  50's copy `canary_literal` — which was already the name of the canary **value**
  assembled six lines below it. The recipe reassigned the variable to the value,
  so `edit` was handed `cafaye_canary_…/templates/secrets/go/canary.go` and died
  with a `FileNotFoundError`. Breakage 50 never ran, and because the script stops
  at the first crash neither did 51: *"the canary is committed as a literal"* and
  *"the zizmor config baselines unpinned-uses"* had silently stopped being
  tested, and the run died before printing its summary. Restored to `kit-04`'s
  naming, where the directory was `twentytwo` and the value `canary_literal`.
  Nothing about reading the file shows this — both lines are correct in
  isolation, `bash -n` is happy, and the header/recipe agreement below is
  perfect while both are wrong — so `self_test_claims` now also asserts that no
  throwaway-copy directory variable is ever reassigned.
- **kit-07 — the declared tier, and the allowlist that is supposed to shrink.**
  A tier is a class of test that needs a real dependency. The failure this
  exists to prevent has already happened in this fleet: a green run in which the
  whole database tier never executed once, because the suite printed `ok`.

  - **`templates/tier/<lang>/` — the declaration, per language, for all seven.**
    Declared in the test source and read by the runner's own collector, never
    grepped for a sentinel. A sentinel fails *open*: a test reaching Postgres
    through a helper two files away does not match Identity's
    `dbtest.Pool|Schema|EnvVar|TEST_DATABASE_URL`, so its package never enters
    the required list and the run is never required to contain it. Rust
    (`#[ignore = "cafaye:tier=db reason=…"]`), Go (`//go:build tier_db`) and
    Python (`@pytest.mark.tier_db`) have a collector that already exists. Ruby
    gets a `tier :db` macro, Elixir a `@tier :db` attribute, and Node and Bun an
    exported `TIER` const — each a **no-op at runtime**, so the collector is a
    ~15-line adapter rather than a parser.
  - **Two collector claims measured, and both corrected the prior claim.**
    `cargo test -- --list --format json` is **nightly-only** (`-Z
    unstable-options`, rustc 1.95.0) — on stable, `--list` includes ignored
    tests and `--list --ignored` gives the ignored subset, which between them
    carry everything the JSON would have. `--list --include-ignored` lists
    *everything* and filters nothing. And `bun test --reporter=junit` **does**
    emit a full inventory: a filtered-out test is still a `<testcase>`, so the
    absent-testcase failure mode does not occur there. What bun lacks is a
    declared *reason* — `test.skip` takes none.
  - **`templates/tier/README.md` — the normalised result format**, the three-way
    `ran` / `skipped` / `filtered` distinction JUnit XML cannot express, the
    allowlist rules, and **what a tier gate cannot catch**. A package filtered
    out of the run entirely is the sharpest: the test asserting the tier ran
    lives *inside* the tier and cannot observe its own absence. Only the
    inventory-vs-run set difference catches it, and that is `caf gate`'s.
  - **`templates/tier/skip-allowlist` — one file for the fleet**, with four
    hygiene rules: every entry names a **reason**, an **owner**, a `since` and a
    `until`; and **an entry matching nothing is a failure**. That last rule is
    modelled on ESLint's `reportUnusedDisableDirectives`, which reports a
    disable comment that no longer suppresses anything. Without it an allowlist is
    a ratchet that only turns one way, and within two quarters it contains every
    test in the repository. The **total is printed on every run, green included**
    — individual entries look justified; the aggregate is the problem.
  - **`required-tier` on the reusable workflow.** Demanded, not inferred: the
    caller names the gate variable (`REQUIRED_DB`) and the workflow exports it
    as `1` on every language job's test step — guard's `GUARD_REDIS_REQUIRED`
    pattern, which fails at *tier-invocation* time, before a report exists. A
    `tier demand` step then fails **naming the variable** if the run produced no
    `ran` line, because a gate variable that is set while a tier runs zero tests
    is a green build that verified nothing. Opt-in: the default is `''`.
  - **`-count=1` mandated on the Go job.** Go keys its test cache on the
    environment a test reads, so a gated and an ungated run already have
    different cache keys — genuinely good news — but mandating the flag removes
    the question rather than reasoning about it, and it costs nothing.
  - **Never cache a test report**, documented in README with the reasoning:
    `restore-keys` matches by **prefix**, and the default branch's cache is
    documented as available to other branches, so a key built from
    `hashFiles('**/lockfile')` restores a report written by a run that *had* the
    database into a run that did not. **A witness from a different run is not a
    witness.** Also stated: fork PRs get read-only cache access, which is a
    cross-trust-boundary path into the gate in any workflow using
    `actions/cache` today.
  - **Floors are relabelled as decrease detectors.** Identity's
    `1254/1166`-style floors are kept and are cheap at catching deletion, but a
    floor is satisfied by *any* 1254 tests including the wrong 1254. Calling one
    a tier gate is worse than having none.

- **`core/` — the `cafaye/core` fan-out standard.** Six repositories copy bytes
  out of `core` and nothing makes the copy reach them. This ships the standard
  that does, plus the two runnable pieces that make it enforceable:
  - `core/vendir/vendir.yml.{muse,pantry,caf}` — the three real consumers, in
    three languages. `muse` and `pantry` are **proven byte-identical (sha256)**
    to what those repositories have committed today, by running vendir 0.46.2
    against the real `cafaye/core`. `caf` **cannot migrate as-is** and its banner
    says why: vendir has no rename, `caf` holds the bytes as
    `manifest-0.2.json`, and core publishes them as
    `cafaye.manifest.schema.json`.
  - `core/vendir/vendir.yml.template` — the onboarding template. Four things to
    change, each marked, each with the reason it is easy to get wrong.
  - `core/renovate/renovate.json5` and `core/renovate/SETUP.md` — one
    `inheritConfig` policy for the fleet, and the ordered steps to stand it up
    **including what to verify before onboarding a second repository**.
  - `core/release/release.yml` — what `core` needs to be taggable. Ships here;
    belongs in `core/.github/workflows/`.
- **`tests/classify.py` + `tests/rules.json` — a change classifier that fails
  closed.** `self_test.sh` proves twenty-three synthetic breakages go red; it
  cannot prove a future change to `event-envelope.schema.json` is one of them. So
  a difference between two vendored schema sets is classified into
  `FILE`/`PACKAGE`/`WIRE_JSON`/`WIRE` (buf's four tiers, because *pick the
  category that matches what your consumers actually depend on*), and **anything
  the catalogue does not name is `UNRECOGNISED`, which is the strictest tier**.
  A new JSON Schema keyword arriving in core cannot be auto-merged green by
  omission. The escape hatch is fenced: a rule may set `breaking: false` only for
  an operation in the closed `advisoryOps` list, or the catalogue refuses to
  load.
- **`tests/staleness.py` — the fleet staleness reporter.** Reads every consuming
  repository's recorded pin — a `vendir.lock.yml` sha *or* the hand-bumped
  `CORE_REF`, because three repositories still use the second — resolves where
  `core` is now, and prints the distance. `--fail-on-behind` makes it a gate;
  `--fail-on-behind` is *off* by default because a stale copy is legal and a
  scheduled report that is red every week is a report that gets muted. Run
  against the real working tree it reports the first measured fleet fact:
  **`muse` is nineteen commits behind**, and `caf` and `pantry` hold vendored
  bytes with **no recorded origin at all**.
- **Three new self-test breakages (18 → 21 at the time of writing; 23 after
  the merge with the tier work).** `includePaths` nested under
  `git:`; the classifier made to **fail open**; the staleness reporter calling an
  undeclared pin `current`. The second is the sharpest proof in the file: it
  inverts the fail-closed property and asserts the suite notices.
- **A check for a file type kit was already shipping unlinted.** The vendir
  templates are YAML under non-`.yml` names, so the `git ls-files '*.yml'
  '*.yaml'` sweep skipped them — and a service that copies one greets its first
  CI run with a failure nobody authored. They are linted by name now.
- **Two new `classify_test.sh` cases that exist to keep the gate honest rather
  than red.** An advisory change must be *reported and not fail*, and a
  reordered `required`/`enum` must not break `FILE` — JSON Schema defines both as
  sets, so a reorder is provably not a semantic change. A gate that goes red on a
  cosmetic edit trains the first person who hits it to reach for the gate rather
  than the cause, which is how a fail-closed gate becomes a fail-open one.
- `core/README.md` records what the fan-out measurement actually found, which is
  **not** what the design was briefed on, and states plainly what stays unproven
  until the first real tag moves.

### Changed

- **`templates/compose/docker-compose.yml` — the vendor config mounts are anchored
  to `${KIT_COMPOSE_DIR:-.}`.** The file is no longer copied into the service, so
  a bare `./` resolves against the service, where `otel-collector.yml` no longer
  is; and Docker's answer to a missing bind source is to **create a directory**, so
  all four backends died with `read /etc/tempo/tempo.yaml: is a directory` —
  naming a file type rather than the thing that is wrong. `docker compose config`
  renders the same project either way, and every static check was green. The
  default `.` is the directory holding this file, so a hand-copied stack is
  unchanged; `bin/dev` sets the variable to the fetched tree.

- **`templates/compose/docker-compose.yml` — Grafana no longer downloads a plugin
  on first boot** (`GF_INSTALL_PLUGINS_PREINSTALL_DISABLED=true`). Grafana 11.3
  preinstalls `grafana-lokiexplore-app` and holds the sqlite lock its own
  migrations want, so a cold start took anywhere from 26s to over **180s** to
  answer `/api/health` — a network call in a dev loop, and one that made the stack
  unstartable for an air-gapped developer. Nothing kit ships uses that plugin:
  both dashboards read Loki through the provisioned datasource and the alert rules
  are PromQL. It is *configuration*, not a modification — the AGPL condition is
  about not building a `grafana/*` image. **The Grafana healthcheck budget was
  left at its shipped value**: the wrong fix, raising the retries, would have hidden
  the network dependency and left the loop unusable offline. With the cause
  removed, Grafana answers at ~26s against a 65s budget and the whole stack is up
  in 76s.

### Fixed

- **`expect_red_check` reported a successful match as a failure, once the output
  was large enough.** It read the checker's verdict through
  `printf '%s\n' "$out" | grep -qF "FAIL $want"`. `grep -q` exits the instant it
  matches, so `printf` takes SIGPIPE while still writing; `set -o pipefail` then
  reports 141 for a pipeline that **succeeded**, and a passing breakage reads as
  "the gate went red, but NOT via `<the named check>`".

  It surfaced on breakage 25, whose check emits several hundred lines and is
  therefore the first output in this file big enough to overflow the 64K pipe
  buffer. Breakages 7-24 all pass on smaller output, which is the worst shape a
  latent defect can have: it presents as a failure of the thing under test while
  being a failure of the harness reading it. Measured rather than reasoned
  about — 2000 lines of output still returns 0 and 5000 returns 141, same match,
  same grep. The threshold is a property of the pipe buffer and would move with
  the machine, so the fix is to **stop piping** (a `case` pattern) rather than to
  bound the output.
- **A check that a comment could satisfy.** The `-count=1` assertion was a plain
  substring test over the go step's `run:` body, and that body's own comment
  block names the flag twice while explaining why removing it would be a
  mistake — so deleting the flag from the command left the check green. Found by
  deliberately breaking the tree, not by reading it. `strip_shell_comments`
  now removes comments while preserving `#` inside quotes, and it is applied
  wherever a check greps a `run:` body.
- **`templates/tier/go/*.go` was never gofmt'ed, and nothing checked it.** The
  gofmt check covered `templates/otel/go/*.go` only, so the new tree shipped
  with doc headings Go 1.19 would rewrite. It is checked now, over both trees.
- **`python3 -m py_compile` wrote `__pycache__/` into the template tree**, and
  the two checks that walk `templates/tier/<lang>/` then died with
  `IsADirectoryError` — a gate that went red on its own artefacts. The parse is
  now `compile()`, which is the same check with no filesystem side effect, and
  both checks skip non-files and *report* a stray directory rather than
  crashing on it.

- **kit-03 rebased onto a master that moved nine commits underneath it.** The
  branch point was `badcc2a`; master gained the move of the reusable workflow to
  `.github/workflows/` (`d42aebb`), kit calling its own workflow (`fb664a9`), a
  real Dockerfile parser and two real Dockerfile bugs (`9a8c3d7`), the gate
  bootstrapping its own dependencies (`a1cad0d`), and the hadolint asset rename
  from `darwin-*` to `macos-*` (`9b3dbeb`). Five files conflicted and all five
  were resolved as unions rather than as a choice between sides:
  - `tests/self_test.sh` — the breakage list is **19**, not master's 18 and not
    kit-03's 12. Master's 7-10 (four ways to break the documented `uses:` string
    against the real path), 11-12 (the two Dockerfile defects) and 13-18 (one
    semantic mutation per language) are intact, and kit-03's `2b` and its
    rewritten recipes for 2 and 4 are kept. Picking a side would have deleted a
    check that currently works, and the self-test's claim is that every breakage
    is caught by a *different* one.
  - `tests/validate.sh` — kit-03's `observability` phase, the `dev_escape_hatch`
    execution check, the eleven observability checks, and master's `callable path`
    check, `tests/bootstrap.sh` wiring and the whole-tree `yamllint` are all
    present. kit-03's own walk of `templates/compose` was **dropped as
    redundant**: master's `yamls_of_the_tree` enumerates by `git ls-files` and
    reaches the same files plus the rest of the repo, and two loops over one set
    of files report every problem twice and disagree about which is
    authoritative.
  - `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md` — both sides' entries, with the
    breakage counts updated to 19 and the CHANGELOG's two `### Added` sections
    folded into one.
  - The collector and compose work was re-pointed at `.github/workflows/`
    rather than reintroducing the old path, and `fb664a9`'s local self-call is
    untouched.
- **The self_test count was a hardcoded string in two places, and both were
  wrong the moment either side added a breakage.** `self_test.sh`'s summary line
  and `validate.sh`'s check label now both **count** the recipes, so the number
  cannot drift from what the file proves. A new check asserts that every
  breakage the header documents has a recipe and every recipe has a header
  entry — the union requirement stated as an assertion, so the next packet that
  adds a breakage without documenting it (or documents one without writing it)
  gets a red gate instead of a stale sentence.

### Added

- **The observability stack** (PLAN.md §7b). Observability is ON BY DEFAULT and
  worked on in dev: `bin/dev up` brings up the OTel collector and the four LGTM
  backing services, and a service with nothing configured exports into them
  because `<SERVICE>_OTEL_ENDPOINT` *defaults* to the collector that ships with
  the stack. `<SERVICE>_OTEL_ENDPOINT` is the only contract (core D16); the
  shipped collector is just its default value, and unsetting it is a genuine
  no-op implemented with `OTEL_SDK_DISABLED`.
  - `templates/compose/otel-collector.yml` — OTLP **and** container-stderr
    receivers, the redaction allowlist **derived from core's schemas**, the
    `spanmetrics` connector, and fan-out to Tempo/Loki/Mimir. Every endpoint is
    a `${env:...}`; the gate fails on a literal.
  - `templates/compose/{tempo,loki,mimir}/` and
    `templates/compose/grafana/provisioning/` — vendor **configuration** and
    Grafana provisioning as files: three datasources, the dashboard provider, two
    dashboards and three alert rules, all working on first load.
  - `templates/compose/docker-compose.yml` — the four backing services, pinned
    to exact tags, healthchecked, memory-bounded, in an `observability` profile.
    **Grafana, Loki, Tempo and Mimir are AGPL-3.0 and ship UNMODIFIED**;
    `tests/validate.sh` fails on a `build:` stanza on any of them.
  - `templates/compose/.env.example` — every `${KIT_*}` the stack reads, with
    the port block documented.
  - `tests/canary_test.sh` — plants a canary in ten shapes a leak could take
    against a real collector and asserts it reaches no exporter, **and** that the
    allowed data survived.
  - `tests/no_telemetry_in_readiness.sh` — proves a service starts, serves and
    reports healthy with the collector killed, and that a collector whose three
    backends all refuse connections stays healthy, does not restart and does not
    enter a retry loop.
  - The six `templates/otel/<lang>/*.snippet` files now honour
    `<SERVICE>_OTEL_ENDPOINT`, default to the shipped collector, implement the
    free no-op with `OTEL_SDK_DISABLED`, record `error.type` and never
    `error.message`, and emit **exception log records** rather than the
    deprecated `exception` span event.
  - `templates/AGENTS.md` — an Observability section, so the endpoint contract
    and "telemetry is never in a readiness path" reach the service repo where a
    probe would actually be written.

- **The secret scanner.** A `secrets` job in `ci.reusable.yml` running
  **gitleaks 8.30.1** over the adopting repository's **full history**, with
  `--redact`. It is the one job in the workflow with **no opt-in**: an opt-in
  security control is not a control, and a secret scanner that only warns is a
  report. `fetch-depth: 0` is load-bearing — the runner default is a shallow
  clone, and a secret committed and deleted in one PR is still in the packfile
  of anyone who cloned. **Adopting this can turn a repo's first build red**;
  README says what to do, and the first thing to do is rotate.
  - gitleaks rather than trufflehog: trufflehog is **AGPL-3.0**, and it is the
    only candidate that verifies live credentials against the issuer's API,
    which for a fleet whose CI has network access is the wrong behaviour for a
    scanner. gitleaks is MIT, a static binary, and makes no network call.
  - `tests/gitleaks_gate.sh` is the **one** scan, called by both the `secrets`
    job and `tests/validate.sh`. A scanner whose CI and local invocations have
    drifted is two scanners, and the one that goes red is whichever nobody runs.
  - `.gitleaks.toml` — the allowlist, and **nothing else**. `extend.useDefault`
    so the rules stay gitleaks', and every `[[allowlists]]` entry must carry a
    `description` of at least 40 characters. An allowlist that grows and is never
    pruned is not an allowlist, it is a deferred disclosure. A `.gitleaksignore`
    fails the gate.
- **A `zizmor` job** (opt-in, `zizmor: 'true'`), running the GitHub Actions
  security audit on the adopting repo's own workflows. `tests/zizmor_gate.sh`
  counts `unpinned-uses` and prints the count and the reason on every run, and
  **fails on every other audit**. It is recorded, not baselined: see
  `DECISIONS.md` (MD10a), where the pin trade is costed in three options and none
  of them has been taken.
- **`templates/secrets/`** — the runtime credential-leak canary. A
  **language-neutral contract** (`templates/secrets/README.md`) and the **Go
  adapter**, with five vectors each carrying its own red proof: log/stdout/stderr,
  unknown serialisation fields, the whole error chain, keys present-but-empty,
  and Go type coverage.
  - It exists because **nothing off the shelf does this**. gosec's
    `credentials.Match` has no `*ast.CallExpr` case, so it finds literals and not
    a token passed to a logger. Bandit matches `ast.Constant` only. Brakeman's
    secret check is off by default. Of 268 Semgrep taint rules, **zero** intersect
    CWE-532.
  - The canary is **assembled at run time**, never written as a literal, so it is
    safe to commit and needs no allowlist entry. Two checks enforce that.
- **Ten new checks** in `tests/validate.sh` for the above, including one that
  asserts the scanner's **behaviour** by executing it: over a throwaway git
  repository holding a detectable credential, the scan must find it, must name
  the rule that fired, must not print the value, and must still find it after the
  file is deleted.
- **Eleven new `self_test` breakages**, each asserting that one *named* check
  went red: a credential in history, a credential in the working tree,
  `--redact` removed, the scan narrowed to the last commit,
  `pull_request_target` added, the `secrets` job made `continue-on-error`, four
  ways of breaking the canary's reference type, the canary committed as a
  literal, and `unpinned-uses` baselined in `.github/zizmor.yml`.
  - These were numbered 13–23 on `worker/kit-04` and are **24–34** here.
    kit-04's other six breakages (its 24–29) were its copies of the six language
    mutants, which master already carried as 13–18; those copies are dropped
    rather than renumbered, so no rule is proved twice under two numbers. The
    union is **34 breakages**, master's 1–23 unmoved.
  - `self_test` counts itself by grepping its own recipe calls, the same
    expression `validate.sh` uses for its label, so the summary and the gate
    label cannot disagree. It was a literal `18` in two files kept in step by
    hand, and for one commit a second runtime counter beside it.
- `tests/gitleaks_gate.sh` and `tests/zizmor_gate.sh`, `chmod +x` and asserted
  executable — they are run by the reusable workflow from a service's repository,
  so a missing executable bit is a `secrets` job that dies in thirteen repos.

### Fixed

- **`artipacked` (9 findings) in `ci.reusable.yml`.** Every `actions/checkout`
  now sets `persist-credentials: false`. No job in the file pushes, so a token
  left on disk after a checkout is a credential that outlives the job for no
  reason — and every job here runs `upload-artifact`, which is the combination
  the audit exists to catch. Found by zizmor, and fixed rather than baselined.
- **`.github/zizmor.yml` is no longer walked for stray copies of the workflow.**
  The `callable path` check reported `tests/self_test.sh` as "a second workflow
  declaring `workflow_call`" — it names the key in a comment explaining breakage
  8. A check that fires on the file proving it wrong is a check people delete.
- **Fetched tools now land in `tests/.bin/`, not `.venv/bin/`.** `.venv` is
  gitignored and `tests/self_test.sh` copies the tree twenty-nine times per run,
  so hadolint and gitleaks were being re-downloaded once per copy. The copy
  carries `tests/.bin`; it does not carry `.venv`.
- **The self_test control run no longer fails on a missing executable bit.**
  `cp -R` does not preserve mode bits on macOS, so every throwaway copy arrived
  with `tests/*.sh` non-executable and the new handed-out-scripts check failed in
  all of them — for a reason that had nothing to do with any breakage under test.

### Changed

- `tests/requirements.txt` pins **`zizmor==1.30.1`**, and an auditor is pinned
  where a parser is not: a new release adds findings, and a gate whose result
  depends on when it last ran is a gate nobody can reason about. zizmor comes
  from PyPI rather than a release archive because it publishes no checksums file,
  and pinning its archives would mean pinning hashes we computed ourselves.
- `kit_bootstrap_binary` takes an asset-name template and an inner-path, so it
  can install a tarball as well as a bare binary, and its sha256 table is keyed
  by **exact asset filename**. It used to be keyed by `macos-arm64`, which forced
  every caller's asset name to be derivable from `<name>-<os>-<arch>` — true for
  hadolint, false for gitleaks, and the reason this function could not install a
  second tool. There are now three spellings of the OS name in play
  (`macos`/`darwin`/`apple-darwin`) and all three are mapped explicitly.
- The `callable path` check's copy-walk skips `.bin` and shell scripts.

### Earlier

- A **`callable path` check** in `tests/validate.sh`: the reusable workflow
  exists at the path callers are documented to use, it declares
  `on: workflow_call`, every real `uses:` that names kit — in `README.md`,
  `AGENTS.md` and this repo's own workflow files — is exactly that path,
  `kit`'s own CI calls it with the local `./` form, and there is exactly one
  copy of it in the tree. The failure it exists for: for six months the file
  sat at `workflows/ci.reusable.yml`, the README told every reader to call
  `cafaye/kit/workflows/ci.reusable.yml@master`, GitHub resolved that to
  nothing, and **every check in the suite was green throughout**. A layout bug
  and a documentation bug that agree with each other are invisible to any check
  that reads only one of them.
- `tests/bootstrap.sh` — the gate now installs its own dependencies.
  `bash tests/validate.sh` is the **whole procedure on a clean clone**: it
  resolves an interpreter, builds `.venv` and pip installs
  `tests/requirements.txt` on first run, printing a `note:` line. `AGENTS.md`
  and the README no longer instruct anyone to run a two-line step first.

  This was the second time the gate failed on arrival. It exited 1 with
  `no python with PyYAML: pip install -r tests/requirements.txt` on every fresh
  clone and every CI runner, because it preferred the gitignored `.venv` and
  fell back to a `python3` that has no PyYAML. The prerequisite was documented,
  which is exactly why it got skipped: by every runner, and by anyone who
  cloned without reading the file first.
- `yamllint` now lints **every** YAML in the tree, enumerated by `git ls-files`
  rather than a hand-kept list of the two compose templates, and a missing
  yamllint is a `FAIL` instead of a `SKIP`. kit ships the config and a repo
  that copies it lints its own CI against it on day one, so a YAML that breaks
  the config greets the first adopting repo with a failure nobody authored. A
  skip here would hide a broken config behind a missing tool on precisely the
  machine that had not run the gate before.
- **`lint/hadolint.yaml`, and real lint on all seven Dockerfiles.** They were
  the only artifact in the tree with no parser at all — seven `SKIP ... (no
  parser for this file type)` lines, honest and completely uncovered, on a file
  every adopting service inherits. They now get three layers: hadolint
  (required, pinned to 2.15.1, verified against hadolint's published
  `checksums.sha256`); a non-root / no-`:latest` / no-`ADD` check for the two
  properties hadolint cannot see; and a check that each template's own
  STRICTNESS NOTES state the non-root guarantee to the reader deciding whether
  to adopt the file.

  **hadolint found a real defect on its first run.** `docker/Dockerfile.python`
  ran `pip install uv` with no version, so the resolver's own version decided
  what every build resolved to — an unpinned build input in the one image whose
  whole point is a frozen resolution. Now `ARG UV_VERSION=0.5.11`, in step with
  the `uv` pin in `templates/mise.toml`.

  **The third check found a documentation bug in the same run.**
  `Dockerfile.bun`'s STRICTNESS NOTES said *"The official image has no
  unprivileged user, so we create one."* `oven/bun:1.3.12-slim` ships `bun` at
  uid 1000 (verified against the running container) and the `useradd` that note
  described was never in the file — the note described a different Dockerfile
  than the one being read. Three of the seven said nothing about non-root at
  all; all seven say so now.
- The one ignored hadolint rule is DL3008 ("pin apt versions"), argued in
  `lint/hadolint.yaml` rather than assumed: a hardcoded `build-essential=12.9`
  in a template thirteen repos copy is a version thirteen people must remember
  to bump, and the day Debian drops that build every one of them fails at once —
  a correlated outage caused by a security patch landing. A service that wants
  reproducible apt resolution pins in its own repo, which is the
  "callers override, they never fork" rule.
- `expect_red_check` in `tests/self_test.sh`, which asserts that one *named*
  check reported `FAIL` rather than merely that the gate went red. Breakages
  7-10 use it, so the check written for each layout/documentation drift is
  proven load-bearing instead of being one of forty checks that could have
  gone red for an unrelated reason.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — kit calling its own reusable workflow with
  `uses: ./.github/workflows/ci.reusable.yml`. The repository that defines the
  standard is now the first repository held to it, and if the callable path ever
  breaks again it is red on kit's own commit rather than discovered by the
  first service that adopts it.
- A `none` value for the `language` input, and a `none` job that runs the
  calling repository's own `tests/validate.sh`. **This is a bug fix, not a
  feature.** The workflow was uncallable by any repository without a service
  manifest — which includes `kit`. `language` is `required: true` and every
  value in `options` named a toolchain, so `uses: ./.github/workflows/ci.reusable.yml`
  had no input that could make it resolve. The job fails when `tests/validate.sh`
  is absent, because a config gate with no gate in it is the same defect as a
  coverage threshold left at `0`.
- `workflows/ci.reusable.yml` — a `bun` job: `bun install --frozen-lockfile` →
  `bun run typecheck` → `bun test`, with an opt-in coverage step. Exists because
  `guard` was hand-rolling a whole workflow for want of one; a repo that adopts
  it can collapse that file to a `uses:` call.
- `workflows/ci.reusable.yml` — an opt-in `telemetry` input (string, default
  `'false'`) and a `telemetry` job that runs the W3C traceparent conformance
  suite for all six languages in a matrix. Opt-in so that adopting kit never
  turns a green repo red.
- `docker/Dockerfile.bun` and `templates/bin-prime/bun.sh` — the other two
  artifacts a language ships, so `bun` is a first-class `language` value.
- `templates/bin/dev.sh` — the local developer loop. `up --wait`, migrate, seed
  an admin, print the URLs. Idempotent; fails loudly and stops *before*
  migrating rather than half-starting.
- `templates/compose/otel-collector.yml` — receiver, batch processor, and a
  `debug` exporter that writes to the collector's own stdout. Sends nothing
  anywhere, by default and by gate. **Superseded by kit-03** below: the
  collector now fans out to Tempo, Loki and Mimir, because observability is on
  by default. The `debug` exporter and the "no literal endpoint" rule stay.
- `templates/otel/<lang>/` — per language: a stdlib `traceparent.*` codec, an
  executed conformance suite, an SDK wiring snippet with a documented
  "when to use which" README, and a statement of the W3C sections implemented.
- `templates/otel/pins.md` — the OTel versions the snippets reference, at the
  otel root because it covers all six languages. kit vendors nothing.
- `README.md` — sections for the local stack and for trace propagation,
  including a worked example of a service adopting propagation, and an accurate
  description of what the gate actually does.


### Fixed

- **`tenant_id` was silently stripped from every trace and log resource.** The
  `redaction/cafaye_metrics` processor listed the private stash names
  (`cafaye.stashed.tenant_id`, `cafaye.stashed.account_id`) in its
  `ignored_keys`; `redaction/cafaye_traces` and `redaction/cafaye_logs` did not.
  The redaction processor deletes every attribute it does not exempt, so on
  traces and logs it deleted the carrier the restore was about to read, and the
  restore put `tenant_id` back from an empty source. Per-tenant metric totals
  worked; per-tenant trace and log identity did not, with no error anywhere.
  **Every static check passed on the broken tree** — being *stashed* and being
  *exempted* are different questions and only the second survives contact with a
  running collector. Two assertions added: every private stash name must be
  exempted in all three processors, and the three `ignored_keys` lists must be
  equal.
- **The collector's `_total` rename never fired, so every dashboard panel
  rendered "No data".** `transform/cafaye_metrics_labels` matched
  `IsMatch(name, "\\.calls$")` inside a YAML *single-quoted* scalar, where a
  backslash is not an escape — so OTTL received a regex requiring a literal
  backslash and it matched no metric, ever. The processor was wired in and
  documented at length. The pattern now avoids escapes entirely.
- **Every Grafana panel had `"datasource": null`**, which Grafana resolves to the
  *default* datasource — Mimir. All LogQL panels and the TraceQL panel were being
  sent to a Prometheus API and rejected (`parse error: unexpected character:
  '|'`); 12 of 15 panel queries were invalid. The alert rules grouped on
  `otel.status_code`, which is a parse error in PromQL because OTLP ingestion
  mangles dots in label names to underscores. Both fixed, and a check now holds
  it: every query must name the backend that can answer it, and every PromQL
  expr must use the underscored spelling.
- **`tests/self_test.sh` had two breakages whose recipes no longer applied.**
  `edit` correctly refuses a stale pattern, so the gate went red on breakage 2
  and never reached 3, and then again on 4. Both recipes rewritten against the
  shipped config; a twelfth breakage added covering a *missing* backend
  exporter, which the set-difference check could never have seen.
- **`tests/no_telemetry_in_readiness.sh` proved less than it claimed.** It passed
  bare `host:port` to the `otlphttp` exporters, which made the collector exit(1)
  with `endpoint must be a valid URL` — indistinguishable from the bug the test
  exists to catch. Its stand-in service was `traefik/whoami`, which ships no
  `wget` (so the probe never ran) and answers every path with 200 (so its
  `/readyz` could never fail). Replaced with a real two-service stack whose
  `/readyz` is proven to go 503 before the "still serving" claim means anything.
- **The canary's redaction receipt was flaky, 1 pass in 3.**
  `docker logs ... | grep -qi` under `set -o pipefail` is a SIGPIPE race: `grep -q`
  exits at the first match, so `docker logs` dies with 141 whenever the log is
  large enough to still be writing. The log is now captured to a file. The
  spanmetrics assertion had the same shape — the connector flushes on its own
  interval — and is now polled with a deadline. Both are PASSes, not NOTEs.
- **The local compose stack could not start.** `otel-collector.yml` resolves its
  values from the collector's own process environment, and Docker Compose does
  not inject the `.env` values it substitutes into containers. Every one resolved
  empty and the collector exited with `processors::memory_limiter: ... must be
  greater than zero`, which names a memory limiter rather than the missing
  environment. The nine `KIT_OTEL_*` values are now passed into the collector
  container. The stack parses, passed every check kit had, and did not work.
- The compose **port check** flagged the collector's in-network bind addresses
  (`0.0.0.0:4317`) as hardcoded published ports. It now reads the parsed
  `ports:` lists, so it can tell a published port from a bind address, and its
  failure message names the service and the value.
- The elixir conformance suite failed 2/13 on two tests that called
  `.outbound_headers` as map access on a struct with no such field, where the
  rest of the file uses the local `outbound/1` helper.
- The elixir "new identifiers are random" test rebound its `seen` set inside a
  `for` comprehension, shadowing the outer binding. The uniqueness assertion
  compared 256 draws against an empty set and could never fail.


### Changed

- **The port block.** Every published host port moved into **15000-15999**,
  one hundred per service: 15000 Grafana, 15500 Postgres, 15600 NATS client,
  15700 NATS monitoring, 15800 Redis, 15900 Tempo, 15901 Loki, 15902 Mimir. Not
  5432/4222/6379, which are the two or three most likely things already
  listening on a developer's machine — and `bin/dev` is the first command a new
  person runs. The gate asserts membership of the block and no reuse, as a RANGE
  rather than a list, so adding a service does not mean editing a check.
  **Unverified against the rest of the fleet**: the block is claimed
  fleet-wide and nothing coordinates it across repos. A sibling repo's scratch
  container was observed holding 15500 during kit-03's own verification.
- **`templates/compose/otel-collector.yml` no longer ships `debug` only.** It
  fans out to three backends now, so the privacy boundary is restated as what it
  can actually be: every endpoint a `${env:}`, the exporter set exactly those
  three plus the local `debug`, and a `redaction/*` processor in every pipeline
  before `batch` and therefore before every exporter.
- `templates/bin/dev.sh` — `STACK_TIMEOUT` 120s → 180s (five more containers,
  four with a real initialisation), brings up the `observability` profile by
  default, prints the wall-clock, and prints the observability URLs. The
  escape hatch is `KIT_DEV_PROFILES=`.
- `templates/compose/docker-compose.yml` — the collector's healthcheck probes
  its real `health_check` endpoint instead of printing its component list, and
  the four stores' healthcheck budgets were raised after measuring them.
- `tests/validate.sh` gained an `observability` phase and a `--no-observability`
  flag; both docker-requiring proofs SKIP loudly when docker is absent.

- **The reusable workflow moved to `.github/workflows/ci.reusable.yml`.** It was
  at `workflows/ci.reusable.yml`, and GitHub documents that subdirectories of
  the workflows directory are not supported — so the `uses: cafaye/kit/workflows/
  ci.reusable.yml@master` line in the README resolved to nothing. No repository
  in the fleet was calling it. It is now a **move, not a mirror**: one file, at
  the only path GitHub will resolve, so there is no second copy to diverge.
- `self_test.sh` grew from 5 breakages to **19** — master's 18 plus kit-03's
  `2b`, which deletes a backend exporter entirely. A set-difference check on the
  exporter set catches an exporter that should not be there and is silent about
  one that is *missing*, and a missing exporter ships a stack that collects
  everything and prints nothing. Six are per-language semantic mutations, each
  against a different W3C section, so
  **every** suite is proven able to fail rather than assumed to. A mutant that
  fails to compile is its own verdict rather than a pass, a missing toolchain is
  a skip that fails the run, and an unmatched mutation is a hard failure so the
  proof cannot rot into proving nothing.
  Both sides' recipes for breakages **2** and **4** were kept, and they are not
  the same recipe: kit-03's rewrote them because they named strings that no
  longer exist — `exporters: [debug]` stopped being the traces pipeline when it
  fanned out to three backends, and a literal `${KIT_POSTGRES_PORT:-5432}`
  stopped existing when the stack moved into the 15000-15999 port block.
  `edit` refuses an unmatched pattern, so a stale recipe fails loudly instead of
  passing silently; that is correct, and it is also how a self_test stops testing
  the thing it names.
  The count in the summary line is now **counted from the recipes** rather than
  written down, and a check asserts that every breakage the header documents has
  a recipe and every recipe has a header entry — so the two cannot drift.
- `validate.sh` reads the CI workflow's `language` options and requires a
  Dockerfile, a `bin/prime` and a `[tools]` pin for each — "half a language is
  worse than none", enforced rather than trusted. It also requires `language`
  options and the job set to be the same list, a ref on every `uses:`, no
  branch refs, and every `${{` to close.
- New checks: the otel-collector environment wiring, that every `*.snippet`
  carries an install line and a pinned version, that every snippet **parses in
  its own language**, and that the README's documented callers only pass inputs
  the workflow actually declares.
- The `telemetry` CI job is a matrix while the seven language jobs stay one-per-
  language: a matrix is right for six stdlib test suites that share nothing, and
  wrong for six toolchains that install different things.
- The `telemetry` input is a string rather than a boolean, because GitHub
  coerces the bare word `false` in some positions and `if: inputs.telemetry` is
  a trap as a result.

### Fixed

- A `pipefail` bug in the new staleness test, where a successful `grep` was
  masked by the classifier command's own deliberate non-zero exit. The output is
  captured to a variable and the status read from the command, never from a pipe:
  **a piped exit code is the exit of the last stage.** The same trap, one level
  down from the one `self_test.sh` already documents at breakage 6.
- The fail-closed tier was stated in **two** places — a string in `classify.py`
  and a rule in `rules.json` — and the self-test breakage written to invert it
  left the suite **green**, because the headline case never reached the line that
  was broken. A property asserted in two places is asserted in zero. Both facts
  now live in `rules.json` alone, and the counterexample is one token.
- A `current`-at-head pin was reported as `unknown`. That is the state a reader
  learns to ignore, which makes it the expensive direction to get wrong.

### Changed

- `AGENTS.md` records that the classifier **fails closed** as a rule about code
  and not about data, and carves `core/`'s two programs out of the config-only
  rule explicitly — stdlib only, nothing imports them, no committed output — so
  that the exception is bounded rather than the start of a trend.
- `AGENTS.md` and `README.md` describe twenty-three breakages rather than
  eighteen, and the phase list gains the classifier and staleness phases.

### Not done, and why

- **No repository was migrated.** `vendir.yml` files for `muse`, `pantry` and
  `caf` are shipped as templates with the exact steps in
  `core/renovate/SETUP.md`; applying them is thirteen pull requests in thirteen
  repositories, and this change is scoped to `kit`.
- **`oasdiff` is not wired in.** It is the right tool for the OpenAPI half — a
  static Go binary, a live GitHub Action, and **755 level-tagged checks** measured
  by running `oasdiff checks changelog` at v1.32.1 — but `core`'s fan-out is raw
  JSON Schema, and adding a pinned binary would make `kit` a repository with a
  dependency, which `AGENTS.md` forbids.
- **`expectOperations` is untouched and stays in `cafaye-ts`.** vendir has no
  opinion about whether a copy should have been allowed to change size, and a
  guard moved into a tool that cannot enforce it is a guard deleted.
- **Three of the fleet's five parity guards still skip** when the core checkout
  they compare against is absent. Fixing that is independent of vendir, more
  urgent than vendir, and belongs to the repositories that own them.


### Earlier (kit-01)

- `README.md` — what kit is, how a service repo adopts it, adoption checklist.
- `AGENTS.md` — conventions for this repo.
- `workflows/ci.reusable.yml` — reusable GitHub Actions workflow. Inputs
  `language` (go|ruby|elixir|python|node|rust), `working-dir`, `versions`, and
  `coverage-fail-under`; one job per language, each install → lint → test →
  coverage. No job builds or pushes an image.
- `lint/` — `yamllint.yml`, `golangci.yml`, `rubocop.yml`, `eslint.config.mjs`,
  each with its strictness decisions written down.
- `docker/Dockerfile.{go,rust}` — multi-stage, distroless final.
  `docker/Dockerfile.{ruby,elixir,python,node}` — multi-stage, `*-slim` final.
  All non-root, none on `:latest`, all versioned through build args.
- `templates/bin-prime/{go,ruby,elixir,python,node,rust}.sh` — worktree
  primers; exit 0 only when the tree is genuinely ready.
- `templates/mise.toml` — per-language tool sections with placeholder versions.
- `templates/AGENTS.md` — skeleton repo-conventions file.
- `tests/validate.sh` + `tests/requirements.txt` — the gate, and its deps.
