# kit template — Go service image. Copy to docker/Dockerfile in the service repo.
#
#   docker build -f docker/Dockerfile --build-arg GO_VERSION=1.24.1 -t svc .
#
# STRICTNESS NOTES
#   - Two stages, always. The builder carries the Go toolchain and a writable
#     $GOPATH; the runtime does not. An image with a compiler in it is an image
#     with a supply chain in it.
#   - CGO_ENABLED=0 so the binary is static. That is what lets the final stage be
#     a runtime with no libc-managed dynamic anything in it. If you need cgo
#     (sqlite, DNS resolution), re-test before you ship it.
#   - The build context is the service root, so `COPY . .` sees go.mod. Set
#     working-dir in the CI caller if the module lives in a subdirectory.
#   - The final stage runs non-root, as uid/gid 65532. There is no passwd entry
#     for that uid in this base, which is fine and is the point: `USER 65532:65532`
#     is numeric, so the kernel enforces it and nothing in the image can widen
#     it. A container running as root is a container where a bug is a host
#     compromise.
#
#   - THE RUNTIME BASE IS DEBIAN-SLIM AND NOT DISTROLESS, and that is a change
#     this file used to argue the other way. It is here because the image now
#     starts through `docker/entrypoint.sh`, which migrates before it serves,
#     and a script needs a shell.
#
#     The claim that motivated distroless was measured rather than assumed, and
#     the measurement went the way nobody expected. Neither distroless variant
#     carries a shell — not `static`, and not `base`:
#
#         $ docker run --rm --entrypoint /bin/sh gcr.io/distroless/base-debian12:nonroot -c 'echo hi'
#         exec: "/bin/sh": stat /bin/sh: no such file or directory
#         $ docker export $(docker create gcr.io/distroless/base-debian12:nonroot) | tar -tf - | grep '^bin/'
#         bin/                       # empty
#
#     So "there is no shell in this image, so a compromised process cannot curl
#     and pipe" and "the entrypoint migrates" cannot both be true. Migrating at
#     boot is the feature (it is what deletes the boot-against-a-stale-schema
#     class); the shell is its price. The price is stated here rather than
#     discovered.
#
#     IF YOU WANT DISTROLESS BACK, the honest way is not a trick: set
#     `ENV KIT_MIGRATE=off`, run migrations from a job (Kamal's `pre-deploy`
#     accessory), and change the final stage back to
#     `gcr.io/distroless/static-debian12:nonroot`. You are choosing
#     "migrate once, out of band" over "migrate at every boot", which is a
#     legitimate trade — just not the default, because an out-of-band migration
#     nobody wired up is the cold-start race this file exists to delete.
#
#   - WHERE THE MIGRATE COMMAND COMES FROM, and why it is not `bin/migrate`.
#     This image copies the compiled binary and nothing else, so the repo's
#     bash+psql `bin/migrate` is not in it — correctly, since there is no `psql`
#     either. A Go service that migrates at boot compiles its own static binary:
#
#         RUN go build -trimpath -ldflags="-s -w" -o /out/migrate ./cmd/${SERVICE_NAME}/migrate
#         COPY --from=build /out/migrate /app/migrate
#         ENV KIT_MIGRATE_CMD=/app/migrate
#
#     and `pgx` is already in the dependency tree, so nothing new is pulled in.
#     With no `KIT_MIGRATE_CMD` and no `KIT_MIGRATE=required`, the entrypoint
#     logs one line and serves — correct for a service that owns no schema, and
#     a lie for one that does, which is why `required` exists. Note that
#     `KIT_MIGRATE_ADVISORY_LOCK` needs `psql` and therefore is NOT available in
#     this image; the entrypoint refuses to start if you ask for it rather than
#     migrating unserialized.
#
#   - `exec "$@"` in the entrypoint, so after the migration the service replaces
#     the shell and is PID 1. SIGTERM still reaches the service.
