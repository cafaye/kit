#
# THE PROOF that one cluster, database-per-service, actually isolates.
#
#   bash tests/isolation_test.sh
#
# WHAT THIS IS, AND WHY IT IS A SEPARATE SCRIPT.
#
#   kit's other suites parse configuration. This one brings up a real Postgres
#   from the stack kit ships, creates two service databases and two service
#   roles, and then asserts that service A is refused at the door of service B's
#   database — printing the query that was refused and the server's answer.
#
#   It exists because "a service that reaches into another's database is a bug
#   in review, not a config problem to solve here" is a claim about a *running*
#   system, and the compose file asserting the right words proves nothing about
#   whether Postgres honours them. AGENTS.md's rule is that a config written from
#   documentation rather than from the pinned image is a config that breaks on
#   the first `bin/dev up`; this file is the answer to that for the one property
#   that cannot be checked any other way.
#
# FOUR ASSERTIONS, and the last three are what make the first one mean something:
#
#   0. the cluster is the shape the contract claims: one database, an owner role
#      and a non-owner LOGIN role per service, membership in one direction only.
#   1. A reaches its own database.                     (positive control)
#   2. A is refused B's database, with the query and the server's answer.
#   3. B is refused A's database.                     (not one lucky direction)
#   4. A is refused on a SECOND cluster built WITHOUT the REVOKE, and gets in.
#      (negative control — proves assertion 2 is load-bearing)
#
#   The ACCOUNT boundary — two tenants of one service — is a different suite,
#   `tests/tenancy_test.sh`, because it is a different subject: this one is about
#   the database, that one is about the rows inside it. Assertion 0 carries the
#   role topology here rather than leaving it entirely to that suite, because this
#   suite is the one that proves the CLUSTER provisioned what
#   templates/database/README.md says it provisions.
#
#   Assertion 4 is the expensive one, and it is the one this repository's rules
#   insist on: a control that never runs differently proves nothing. Without it,
#   a check that asserted "A cannot read B" would also pass on a cluster with no
#   boundary at all, because the table grants would refuse the SELECT anyway.
#
# SKIPS LOUDLY, NEVER SILENTLY. No docker, no image, no network to GHCR: this is
# a SKIP that names what it needed, and `validate.sh` counts it. A skip is
# honest; a skip reported as a pass is the thing this repository forbids.

# ONE NAME FOR THE WHOLE RUN, and every namespace this suite touches is derived
# from it. It was `kit-isolation`, written out in four places, and a compose
# project name is the namespace for that stack's containers, networks and volumes
# — so two concurrent runs were not two stacks but one stack with two owners.
# Observed rather than argued: with one name, a second run cannot bring up a
# cluster (`removal of container … is already in progress`) and the first run dies
# part way through its assertions with psql's exit code and no FAIL line of its
# own, because the other run's teardown took the project volume out from under
# it. Through validate.sh's summary that reads as a database-boundary violation,
# which is the one claim this file exists to make trustworthy.
#
# `$$` is the convention the four other docker tiers already use (canary, stack
# live, readiness, deploy) and it is unique among live processes, which is the
# scope that matters: CI gives every job its own daemon, so uniqueness has to hold
# among processes on one machine and no further. A `mktemp` would be stronger and
# would also be a second idiom in this directory; DECISIONS.md records the trade.

# THE HOST PORT, and this is a fixed name of the same class wearing a different

# than a fixed project name because it collides with the developer's own running
# stack, not merely with another test run. It also has to move for the fix to be
# checkable: two concurrent runs of THIS tier both bind 15521, so deriving only
# the project name would leave the second run red on `port is already allocated`
# and the collision unfixed.
#
# This suite never connects to postgres from the host — every query goes through
# `docker exec` — so the port is published only because the shipped compose file
# publishes it, and moving it is enough to keep the two runs apart. The search is
# the same dependency-free one stack_live_test.sh uses (`/dev/tcp`, no `nc`, no
# python), for the same reason: nothing here may assume a tool is installed.
#
# The SEARCH itself is below `fail`'s definition, which shellcheck is right to
# insist on: a function used before it is defined is a function that does not
# exist yet, and under `set -e` that turns into a confusing exit 127 rather than
# the named failure it is meant to be.

# Where the state goes. A named container and a named volume rather than
# `docker run --rm`, because assertion 4 needs a SECOND cluster that survives
# long enough to be queried and the first one has to still exist.
