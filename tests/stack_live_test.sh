#
# kit's proof that the FETCHED stack actually runs, and that traces arrive in
# the store behind them and derived metrics reach the only place there is one.
#
#   bash tests/stack_live_test.sh
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHY IT IS NOT `docker compose config`
#   `docker compose config` proves a file parses. It has been green on a stack
#   that could not start, on a collector whose exporters pointed at a port
#   nothing was listening on, and on a bind mount naming a directory four
#   containers later. kit's own history says so twice: the collector's
#   `environment:` block was missing, so every `${env:}` resolved empty and the
#   collector exited naming a memory limiter; and a store's healthcheck named a
#   directory, so the stack came up and then reported one unhealthy service for
#   two minutes.
#
#   So this brings the whole thing up, sends it a real OTLP payload, and reads
#   the data back out of Tempo over HTTP. If the fetch produced a tree that
#   cannot run, nothing here can pass.
#
# WHAT IS PROVED, IN ORDER
#   1. `bin/dev` fetches kit at a pinned ref and the STACK COMES UP HEALTHY —
#      every container, `--wait`, no sleeps.
#   2. The collector is running the fetched `otel-collector.yml`, not a copy
#      from the working tree. Asserted by diffing the container's mounted file
#      against the fetched one.
#   3. A TRACE arrives in Tempo, with the resource attributes the redaction
#      boundary is supposed to preserve.
#   4. A DERIVED METRIC reaches the collector's own stdout, under the `cafaye_`
#      namespace the spanmetrics connector mints, with the high-cardinality
#      dimensions gone. There is no metrics STORE and there has not been one
#      since it cost 130s of readiness budget per cold start; where the data
#      goes is the collector's `debug` exporter, and this reads it there.
#   5. The redaction boundary held ON THE LIVE STACK: the canary is in the
#      trace store and in neither the exported attributes nor the exported
#      metric. `canary_test.sh` proves the same property against a substituted
#      exporter; this proves it against the real fan-out, which is the only way
#      to know it is wired to what ships and not to nowhere.
#
# THE REMOTE IS LOCAL
#   A bare repository is built from this tree and fetched over `file://`, so the
#   fetch is the real one and the suite needs no network. The stack then runs
#   from the FETCHED TREE, not from the working tree — which is the property
#   under test, and the reason `$ROOT` never appears as a mount source below.
#
# EVERYTHING IS A THROWAWAY
#   Its own compose project name, its own `KIT_STACK_HOME`, and
#   `down --volumes` on the way out. No port outside 15000-15999 is touched, and
#   `KIT_STACK_NAME` is suffixed with this run's pid so two runs cannot collide.
#
# NO SLEEPS. Every wait is a poll on a health or content signal with a deadline.

# command substitution and bash will run it. An earlier version of this comment
# sat INSIDE the heredoc and every backticked word in it was executed —
# `docker-compose.yml`, `bin/dev`, `isolation_test.sh`, `kit_probe` all came
# back "command not found", the test still exited 0, and the line that was
# supposed to declare the tenant never reached the `.env` at all. So prose about
# this file goes HERE, and the heredoc below stays nothing but assignments.
#
# The one line below is here because the template now REQUIRES it.
# `docker-compose.yml` passes `KIT_POSTGRES_DATABASES` through with no `:-`
# fallback at all, on purpose: a shared-infrastructure template that defaults the
# tenant list to one of its own services silently hands every adopter that
# forgets to declare itself somebody else's database (measured on identity: it
# asked for `identity`, the cluster provisioned `courier`). So the init script
# refuses an unset list by name rather than inventing one.
#
# That refusal is correct, and it caught this file. With the fallback removed,
# `bin/dev up` here exited non-zero with
#
#     10-cluster.sh: line 48: KIT_POSTGRES_DATABASES: KIT_POSTGRES_DATABASES is
#     unset. Name the services, comma-separated.
#
# and the container exited 1 — a stack that could not start, which is the right
# outcome for a consumer that declared nothing. This test WAS such a consumer,
# and the reason is worth stating plainly: this file is kit's own harness
# consuming kit's own template, so a harness that forgot to declare itself looks
# exactly like "the template broke". `isolation_test.sh` was always a correct
# consumer and already declared `ALPHA,BETA`; this one did not, and the only
# thing that found out was the test that actually brings the cluster up.
#
# A consumer declares what it wants. `kit_probe` is named for this test and
# nothing else, which also means the init script runs — so this file now proves
# one more thing than it used to: that a declared tenant is really created.

# 5. the DERIVED METRIC REACHES THE COLLECTOR'S OWN STDOUT
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHERE THIS LOOKED BEFORE, AND WHY IT CANNOT LOOK THERE ANY MORE. This section
# used to query a metrics store over its published PromQL port for two things:
# the metric the probe sent directly, and the one the `spanmetrics` connector
# minted from the trace. That store cost 130s of readiness budget per cold start
# (retries 12 x interval 10s) against a 180s deadline for the whole stack, and
# was removed rather than left half-wired — no service, no volume, no port, no
# exporter dialling a host with nothing on it.
#
# So the assertions move to the collector's `debug` exporter, which is where the
# metrics pipeline goes now, and which is a BETTER place to read them from: the
# store answered a question about what survived to disk, and the exporter
# answers the question the change is actually about, which is whether the
# derived series still pass the ingest deny set on the way OUT. Nothing in this
# tree stores metrics, so the collector's stdout is the last place a dropped
# dimension can still be observed — and it is observable, because the export
# prints the attribute map (see `KIT_OTEL_DEBUG_VERBOSITY=detailed` in the .env
# this test writes above).
#
# `collector_logs` reads the container rather than a file, because a file
# exporter standing in for the fan-out is exactly what `canary_test.sh` already
# substitutes and what this test exists not to do.

# is a proof that the CONFIG reached the container and that the connector is
