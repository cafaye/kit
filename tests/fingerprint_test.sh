#
# kit's proof that `tests/fingerprint.py` cannot lie.
#
#   bash tests/fingerprint_test.sh
#
# WHAT THIS IS FOR
#
#   A cache is a device for handing back a verdict somebody already reached. The
#   only thing standing between that and a machine that reports PASS for work it
#   never did is the set of conditions under which it is allowed to hand one
#   back. Nothing in `fingerprint.py` can make a check green on its own, and
#   this file is what makes that claim checkable rather than a sentence in a
#   docstring.
#
#   So every claim below is a COUNTEREXAMPLE: a cache that says HIT, and a tree
#   where the honest answer is "run it". A test suite that only proves the happy
#   path has proved that the happy path works, which is the one thing a cache is
#   guaranteed to do.
#
# THE FOUR WAYS, AND WHY THESE FOUR
#
#   1. outputs deleted, fingerprint unchanged  -> RE-RUN. This is P0-4's second
#      clause and the one that matters most: "same hash AND outputs still on
#      disk". A cache that honours the hash and ignores the disk returns green
#      for a tree whose work was thrown away, and the failure is silent because
#      every number in the log looks right.
#   2. one byte of one declared input changed -> RE-RUN. The whole mechanism,
#      in its smallest possible unit. A cache keyed on mtime would pass this
#      only when the clock moved, and a cache keyed on the file NAME would never
#      pass it at all.
#   3. a corrupt or truncated record           -> RE-RUN, distinctly, and never
#      a crash. Corrupt is given its own exit code precisely so that it is not
#      indistinguishable from a cold cache in the logs.
#   4. a record from another kit version       -> REFUSED, by name. Honoring it
#      means honoring a verdict about a check that may no longer exist.
#
# AND THE GREEN CONTROL, which is the sharpest line in the file
#
#   Proof 9 does NOT prove the cache is correct. It proves the cache CAN BE
#   WRONG: a manifest that forgets to declare the file the check reads returns
#   HIT after that file changes, and hands back the old PASS. That is not a bug
#   in `fingerprint.py` — a fingerprint can only be as complete as its
#   declaration, and no amount of hashing repairs an omission. It is a fact about
#   the mechanism, and it is the reason the rollout in the report is a list of
#   declarations to be written rather than a flag to be flipped.
