#
# THE PROOF that kit's account-isolation templates isolate a tenant.
#
#   bash tests/tenancy_test.sh
#
# WHAT THIS IS, AND WHY IT IS A SEPARATE SCRIPT.
#
#   kit's other suites parse configuration. This one brings up a real Postgres
#   from the stack kit ships, applies `templates/database/tenancy/substrate.sql`,
#   runs `templates/database/tenancy/isolation.sql`, and reports every assertion —
#   printing the ones that failed, with the reason each one exists.
#
#   It exists because "a service that reads another tenant's rows is a bug in
#   review" is a claim about a RUNNING system. AGENTS.md's rule is that a config
#   written from documentation rather than from the pinned image is a config that
#   breaks on the first `bin/dev up`; this is the answer to that for the account
#   boundary, which cannot be checked any other way.
#
# NINE THINGS, and the last five are what make the first one mean something:
#
#   1. every assertion in isolation.sql passes.        (the property)
#   2. the CONTROL: with `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` removed, the OWNER half of the
#      spine goes red and the LOGIN half stays green.   (the property is
#      load-bearing, and it is load-bearing FOR THE OWNER specifically — which is
#      the half a policy's mere presence cannot satisfy)
#   3. the init plan, MEASURED: a wrapped policy calls the identity function once
#      per statement and a bare one calls it once per candidate row. (a comment
#      saying so is not a measurement)
#   4. the assertion set is EXACTLY the one assertions.txt names, both ways.
#      (the proof has not quietly shrunk)
#   5. an ADOPTER'S FIXTURE SCHEMA, planted before the proof runs, is out of the
#      sweep's scope and the proof is still green.  (0b: the sweep does not
#      assume it owns the database)
#   6. an unprotected account-scoped table in a schema the substrate DOES own
#      turns the proof red.                            (5: and scoping the sweep
#      did not turn it into a green constant)
#   7. THE DATABASE'S OWN ADVISOR, `templates/database/tenancy/advisor.sql`, run
#      against this cluster, reports ZERO ERROR and zero WARN on the two tables
#      the substrate wrote.                            (the one question the five
#      above cannot ask: a policy that PERMITS everything satisfies every denial,
#      because a denial cannot tell permitted-by-predicate from
#      permitted-by-accident)
#   8. every rule in that advisor FIRES on a fixture built to trip it, naming
#      itself and the object it fired on, AND stays silent on four views built to
#      prove it is selective.                (a detective that has never fired is
#      a detective you cannot trust; one that fires on everything is a detective
#      nobody reads)
#   9. THE AUDIT ANSWERS EVERY ROLE THE SAME. `cafaye.credential_tables()` is
#      read as the owner, as the cluster's admin role and as the non-owner LOGIN
#      role; the three answers must be identical AND non-empty.  (8: an audit
#      whose answer depends on the reader's `search_path` reports "no credential
#      path in this database" to the one role whose `"$user"` schema is `cafaye`,
#      which is the most expensive reading in the file to believe)
#
#   Assertion 2 is the expensive and the important one. It is the control this
#   repository's rules insist on: a control that never runs differently proves
#   nothing. Without it, a proof that asserted "the owner reads no rows" would
#   also pass on a template with no FORCE at all — which is precisely the trap
#   this file exists for, because FORCE is absent from Supabase's guide and no
#   lint in this fleet checks for it.
#
#   Assertions 0b and 5 are one measurement in two directions, and neither means
#   anything alone. `identity` adopted this substrate and its whole-suite run then
#   failed kit's account-isolation control: its test helper builds a private
#   fixture schema per test by cloning tables with `LIKE ... INCLUDING ALL`, which
#   does not copy row-level security, so every fixture carries an `account_id`
#   column and no policies -- and a sweep that scanned the whole database named
#   all of them, with the count moving per run (5, then 21) as neighbours went in
#   and out of flight. 0b plants that shape and requires it to be ignored. 5
#   requires an unprotected table in the substrate's OWN schema to still be
#   named. Narrow the scope to `pg_temp` alone and 0b passes forever while 5 goes
#   red, because every real table in every adopter is then outside it: which is
#   the only reason 5 exists rather than 0b by itself.
#
# SKIPS LOUDLY, NEVER SILENTLY. No docker, no image, no network to GHCR: this is a
# SKIP that names what it needed, and `validate.sh` counts it. A skip is honest; a
# skip reported as a pass is the thing this repository forbids.

# ASSERTION 5 — THE SWEEP'S OWN CONTROL, INSIDE THE SCOPED SWEEP.

# tempting version of this fix. Scope the sweep to `pg_temp` alone, or to
# `cafaye` alone, and all three sweep assertions pass forever while naming no

# information, and the sweep's positive control is now a control of nothing.
#
# So: a SECOND unprotected account-scoped table, planted in a schema the
# substrate WAS applied in and left there permanently, must turn the proof red.

# ASSERTION 7 — THE HONEST NEGATIVES. A detective that has never fired is a
# detective you cannot trust, so every rule is run against a fixture BUILT TO TRIP
# IT, and each must name itself.
#
# Every fixture below is in its own schema, the substrate was never applied to it,
# and the advisor is scoped to that schema alone. That is not tidiness: it is what
# makes the control specific. Scoped to the whole database, a rule that fires
# proves only that the advisor returned rows, and seven of these nine could be
# satisfied by any of the others. Named rule, named fixture, one rule proven able
# to fire.
#
# AND WHAT IT STILL CANNOT PROVE, which is why 7b exists below: that any of them
# is SELECTIVE. A rule that fires on every view, every policy or every table is
# satisfied by this assertion as completely as a rule that fires on exactly the
# right one. `security_definer_view` is the rule where that matters most, because
# the two ways to write it badly are "fires on nothing" and "fires on everything",
# and only one of them is a control.
#
# AND IT IS ALSO WHAT PROVES THE ADVISOR STANDS ALONE. Nothing here calls a
# `cafaye.*` function the substrate owns except the two identity seams a policy
# has to be written against — so these fixtures are a schema on a database where
# the substrate was applied to `public` and nothing else, which is the shape of
# the service that has not finished adopting.

--                    account-scoped table, which IS the hole: its queries run
--                    as its owner, so the policies on `protected_accounts` are
--                    evaluated against a role that is exempt from them.
--   invoker_view     THE NEGATIVE THAT MATTERS. The SAME view over the SAME
--                    table with `security_invoker = true`, which is the whole
--                    remediation. A rule that reports this one is reporting its
--                    own fix as the disease, and a reader who saw both rows
--                    would stop reading both.
--   plain_reads      THE Misfire GUARD. A view over a table with NO row-level
--                    security at all. There is no policy to bypass, so this is
--                    not the finding — and if the rule fired here it would fire
--                    on every reporting view in every schema, which is how a
--                    security rule gets switched off.
--   definer_no_grant A view nobody can reach. The bypass is real and no caller
--                    can reach it, so it is not this rule's finding.
--
-- `definer_no_grant` NEEDS A NOLOGIN OWNER, and that is a measurement rather
-- than a stylistic choice. The fixture is created by `alpha`, which is a LOGIN
-- role, so alpha OWNS the view and `has_table_privilege` is true for the owner
-- alone — `REVOKE ALL … FROM PUBLIC` does nothing, because ownership is not a
-- grant and revoking every grant does not touch it. Measured: with a LOGIN owner
-- the rule fires; with a NOLOGIN owner it is silent. The first run of this
-- fixture failed exactly here, which is why the comment above says what it says.
--
-- THE UNREACHABLE VIEW IS BUILT BY THE CLUSTER ADMIN, and that is a measurement
-- rather than a convenience. Two failed fixtures led here, and both are worth
-- writing down because the rule was right in both cases and the FIXTURE was not:
--
--   1. The fixture is applied as `alpha`, which is a LOGIN role, so alpha OWNS
--      the view. Ownership is not a grant, so `revoke all … from public` does
--      nothing and the rule fires. Measured: ownership alone is enough.
--   2. Giving the view a NOLOGIN owner is not enough either, because reaching
--      that owner needs `grant <owner> to alpha` — MEMBERSHIP, and membership
--      carries the owner's privileges. Measured: with `alpha` a member of the
--      owner role, `has_table_privilege('alpha', …, 'SELECT')` is TRUE through
--      the membership and the rule fires, correctly.
--
-- So the fixture is built by `cafaye`, the cluster's admin role, which is
-- excluded from `api_roles` by exactly the predicate every other rule here uses
-- (`not rolsuper`). A superuser-owned view that no login role can reach is a
-- real and common shape — and it is the shape a reporting view has when it is
-- owned by the migration role and nobody was granted SELECT on it.
--
-- It is a SEPARATE script, applied by the admin after the schema exists, because
-- it cannot be part of the one `alpha` applies: alpha is the schema's owner and
-- a `set role` in the middle of that script would leave the rest of it running
-- as someone else. `advisor_unreachable_fixture.sql` below.
--
-- AND THE TRANSITIVE ONE, because a view over a view is the same hole: Postgres
-- evaluates the outer view with the outer view's owner's privileges and the
-- inner one with the inner one's, and no hop in that chain puts a caller's
-- policies back in force. `nested_definer_view` reads ONLY another view and no
-- table, so a rule that stopped at the first hop would miss it — and it is the
-- view a caller actually queries.
--
-- `over_invoker_view` is the converse and is the guard on the fix: it reads only
-- an invoker view, so the walk must STOP at that hop rather than walking past
-- it and reporting a chain whose innermost link is already correct.

# ASSERTION 7c — THE FUNCTION HOP, ITS CONTROL, AND ITS OPPOSITE.
#
# The list above proves rule 4 CAN fire on a helper-routed policy. It cannot
# prove the hop is what made it fire, and those are different defects: a rule
# that fired on `helper_routed` because it fires on EVERY policy in the schema
# satisfies the list identically. Three checks, and the second and third are the
# ones with teeth:
#
#   1. the finding NAMES the function. `via_functions` is not decoration: it is
#      the only column that says the route was a function, and a reader who is
#      told "policy reads kit_advisor_fixture.writable_flags" and nothing else
#      has to go and work out which of the two policies in this fixture is
#      talking about a SECURITY DEFINER helper.
#   2. THE CONTROL answers differently ON THE SAME TABLE. `direct_policy` reaches
#      the SAME `writable_flags` with no function in the path, and its
#      `via_functions` must be EMPTY. One table, two routes, opposite answers --
#      so the rule is reading the route. Delete either check and this pair is
#      one observation instead of two, which is the shape AGENTS.md calls a
#      control two checks could satisfy.
#   3. `helper_opaque` is SILENT, and this is the negative that decides whether
#      the two positives mean anything. It reaches the same table through a
#      helper whose body pg_depend does not record (measured:
#      `measure-advisor-pgproc.sql`, a `language sql` STRING body records
#      pg_namespace and nothing else). The rule must not fire on it, because the
#      only way to fire is to read `prosrc` and match a table name in SQL text,
#      and a rule that does that fires on a table named in a comment. So this
#      silence is the LIMIT of the rule, asserted rather than apologised for, and
#      rule 6 fires on the helper itself -- which is the honest position: a

# The list above proves every rule CAN fire. It cannot prove any rule is

# the rule: the two ways to write it are "fires on every view in the schema" and
# "fires on nothing", and only one of those is a security control. The other is
# a report nobody reads — or a detective that has never fired.
#
# Four views in the fixture schema are here to be SILENT, and each one is silent
# for a different reason, so satisfying all four means the rule is reading
# something rather than counting something:
#
#   invoker_view        the same view over the same table, fixed. A rule that
#                       reports its own remedy would print both rows.
#   plain_reads         a view over a table with NO row-level security. Nothing
#                       to bypass, so nothing to report.
#   definer_no_grant    the hole is real and no login role can reach it.
#   over_invoker_view   reads only an invoker view, so the transitive walk must
#                       STOP at that hop rather than walking past it.

# ASSERTION 8 — THE AUDIT ANSWERS THE SAME TO EVERY ROLE THAT ASKS.
#
# `cafaye.credential_tables()` is the one query that answers "which tables in this
# database can be read with no account", and `isolation.sql` asserts it as the
# session's own role — which on a real cluster is the owner's, a role with no
# schema of its own. So the audit was only ever measured from the one reader it
# happened to be correct for.
#
# The trap is the READER, not the SQL. `pg_get_expr` drops the schema from a name
# the reader can resolve, and what a reader can resolve is their `search_path` —
# and `"$user"` is a search_path entry. So the SAME policy deparses
# `cafaye.current_credential_digest()` for `alpha` (no `alpha` schema exists) and
# `current_credential_digest()` for `cafaye` (whose `"$user"` schema IS the
# `cafaye` schema the substrate creates). An audit written against that text
# returns everything to one role and NOTHING to the cluster's own admin role,
# which reads as "this database has no credential path at all" to exactly the
# reader most likely to act on it.
#
# TWO HALVES, and the second is what stops the first from being vacuous:
#
#   A. THE PROPERTY. Three readers — the owner, the cluster's admin role, and the
#      non-owner LOGIN role — must get the SAME answer, and that answer must be
#      non-empty. Agreement alone is satisfiable by a function that returns
#      nothing to everybody, which is a green assertion about an audit that has
#      stopped working.
#   B. THE CONTROL. The two spellings must actually DIFFER on this cluster, or
#      half A is asserting nothing about the mechanism it names. A red here is
#      true rather than a flake: it says Postgres no longer deparses by the
#      reader's visibility, and this suite's control needs rewriting because the
#      reason it exists has changed.
#
# `public.api_keys` is the fixture — assertion 6's credential table, still in
# place — and the printed column is the deparsed policy itself, because the whole
# claim is about that text differing between two sessions that share one policy.
