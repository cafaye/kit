#
# kit's proof that the deploy story works, and that it can fail.
#
#   bash tests/deploy_test.sh
#
# WHAT IS PROVED HERE, IN ORDER OF HOW MUCH IT CAN BE FAKED
#
#   1. STATIC, no docker. The redaction boundary actually redacts. Not "the
#      file exists" — the filter is EXECUTED against a known secret and a JWT
#      and a connection string, and the assertions are that the canary is
#      absent AND that the surrounding text survived, because a filter that
#      deletes the whole line passes "no canary found" while being useless.
#
#   2. STATIC, no docker. The tool refuses the inputs that would leak. A
#      secret named as a file path, a secret nobody claims, a secret too short
#      to be a credential, a multi-line secret. Each is a refusal, and each
#      refusal is asserted by exit status AND by the message.
#
#   3. LIVE, a real deploy. `courier` is deployed as a release image and its
#      health gate goes GREEN.
#
#   4. LIVE, the red proof. The database is stopped underneath the running
#      service and the readiness endpoint is watched going 503, the container
#      healthcheck is watched going unhealthy, and `deploy verify` is watched
#      exiting non-zero. This is the assertion that gives every other "it is
#      healthy" in this file its meaning: a check that has never been seen red
#      is a check that might not be checking.
#
#   5. LIVE, the restore. The database comes back and all three go green
#      again, because a red that never clears is a different bug from one that
#      does.
#
  # 6. LIVE, rollback. A second artifact is deployed and then rolled back, and
  #     the previous artifact is shown to be the one actually serving. The image
  #     REFERENCE the container was created from is compared, not the digest —
  #     the two tags share an image and therefore share a digest, so a digest
  #     assertion would pass against a rollback that did nothing at all.
#
#   6b. LIVE, the automatic rollback. A deliberately broken artifact — the good
#      image with `/app/bin/migrate` removed — is deployed, and the deploy must
#      exit non-zero, say that it is rolling back, and leave the previous
#      artifact serving WITHOUT anyone asking. Until this section existed, the
#      sentence "a deploy that cannot reach green rolls itself back" was the
#      most load-bearing claim in the packet and it rested on reading the source.
#
#   7. LIVE, the leak audit. After all of the above, the deploy log, the
#      rendered compose config and `docker inspect` are searched for every
#      secret value that was supplied. All three must be clean. This is the
#      check that would catch the most damaging thing this packet could get
#      wrong, and it runs LAST, against the accumulated evidence.
#
#   8. LIVE, restart policy. The application process is killed FROM INSIDE the
#      container — `docker kill` from outside is an operator-initiated stop,
#      which `restart: unless-stopped` deliberately does not resurrect — and
#      Docker is watched bringing it back. Then the honest half: the tmpfs is
#      gone, so the restarted container comes back BLOCKED at the credential
#      gate and must not be serving, and re-running the deploy is the repair.
#
#   9. LIVE, teardown, and the proof that teardown is scoped. `down` and
#      `down --purge` are asserted to differ on the volume, the ledger is
#      asserted to die with the stack, and a container and a volume that belong
#      to nobody here are asserted to SURVIVE both. "Never touch state you do
#      not own" is the one constraint in this packet that was otherwise only
#      asserted by reading the source, which is not a proof.
#
# NO SLEEPS. Every wait is a poll on a real signal — an HTTP status, a
# container health status, an image digest — with a deadline. `sleep` appears
# only as the interval BETWEEN polls, which is how often this script is allowed
# to ask, not how long it guesses something takes. This matches
# `tests/no_telemetry_in_readiness.sh`, which is the house pattern.
#
# IT TOUCHES NOTHING IT DID NOT CREATE. Every container, network and volume
# here belongs to the compose project `kit-deploy-test-$$` and is removed on the
# way out, volumes included. There is no `docker system prune` anywhere in this
# file and no command that is not scoped to that project by name.
