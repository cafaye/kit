#
#     bash tests/validate.sh
#
# A gate that needs an undocumented manual step is not a gate. `validate.sh`

# `.venv` is gitignored, so *every* fresh clone and *every* CI runner hit that
# — including the CI job this repository now runs on itself. A developer who
# read the two-line instruction in AGENTS.md was fine; a CI runner and anyone
# who cloned without reading were not. That is a gate that fails on arrival
# rather than on content.
#
# So the gate installs its own dependencies on first run, into a directory it
# already owns (`.venv/`, gitignored). Nothing here is a kit dependency: kit
# still ships no library, no lockfile and no runtime code. These are the tools
# the test suite runs, exactly as `shellcheck` is — except that shellcheck is
# optional and these are not, because the suite cannot proceed without them.
#
# Resolved in this order, and the order is the contract:
#
#   1. $KIT_PYTHON — an explicit override is a promise. If it is set and cannot
#      import yaml, that is a configuration error and we say so rather than
#      silently building a second interpreter the caller did not ask for.
#   2. $ROOT/.venv/bin/python — what a previous run of this gate bootstrapped.
#   3. whatever python is on PATH that already has PyYAML — a developer with it
#      system-installed should not pay for a venv.
#   4. bootstrap: create .venv and pip install tests/requirements.txt.
#
# Steps 2 and 3 matter for speed and step 4 for correctness, in that order: a
# warm .venv means a normal gate run never touches the network.

# kit_bootstrap_python — sets $PY, or exits 1 with one paste-able command.
#
# Sets a variable rather than echoing a path because every caller wants it as a
# variable. SC2034 fires on all four assignments because nothing in THIS file
# reads it back; the readers are the two scripts that source this one.

# without inventing a naming convention the caller then had to match. Keying on
