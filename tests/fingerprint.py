WHAT THIS IS

  moon's `TaskFingerprint` (refs/moon/crates/task-hasher/src/task_fingerprint.rs:10-53)
  and `task_runner.rs:238-256` do two things: they hash a MANIFEST — the declared
  inputs, by content — and they skip a run only when the fingerprint matches, the
  last exit was 0, and the outputs are still on disk. This file is that pair,
  for a bash gate that has no task graph.

  The word that matters is DECLARED. A cache key built from mtimes, or from
  whatever files a check happens to read, is not a fingerprint: it is a guess
  about the future. A fingerprint is a list somebody wrote down, and the whole
  value of the mechanism is that the list is auditable in the same commit as the
  check it guards.

THE SCHEMA, and why each field is in it

  schema    int, bumped BY HAND. A record written under a different schema is
            REFUSED BY NAME rather than parsed under rules it was not written
            under. Same rule, same reason as `caf lock`'s `LockVersion`
            (cafaye/caf/internal/lock/doc.go): "an older lock says so by name
            rather than being parsed under rules it was not written under."
  tool      kit's VERSION file content at write time. A record from another kit
            build is refused outright, because the check it recorded may not be
            the check that runs now.
  check     the stable id. This is the `--only` name and the `bounded_check`
            label's first field; it is the identity a later caller reads.
  command   the exact argv, so an edited command line cannot hit.
  inputs    [{path, sha256}] sorted by path. CONTENT, not mtime — see below.
  outputs   the declared output globs. Their MATCHED PATH SET is hashed into the
            record and re-checked on lookup; see `output_paths_hash`.
  env       the environment variables the check actually honours, resolved.
  version   the fingerprint schema's own version. Distinct from `schema`: this
            one is "how the fingerprint is computed", that one is "how the record
            is stored".

WHY SHA-256 OF BYTES, AND WHY THAT IS NOT A SECOND IMPLEMENTATION

  `caf lock` already made this exact decision in this fleet and wrote down why
  (cafaye/caf/internal/lock/doc.go, "The hash is of the bytes, and the lock is
  not about git"): no git blob ids, no index hashes, because a pin that can only
  be verified inside a checkout cannot be verified in the tarball a release
  ships or in a Docker build context. This file uses `hashlib.sha256` — the
  stdlib, the same primitive — over raw file bytes, with NO salt of its own and
  NO timestamp in the hashed material. The version discipline is shared; the
  code cannot be, because `caf lock` is Go in a sibling repository that a kit
  clone does not contain, and a gate that shells out to a sibling checkout is
  not hermetic. Same algorithm, same rationale, one implementation each language.

  The salt that DOES exist is a field: `schema`, `tool` and `version` are inside
  the bytes being hashed, so a fingerprint computed by a future kit cannot
  collide with one computed by this one even if the inputs are identical.

NO TIMESTAMP IN THE HASHED MATERIAL

  `caf lock` twice over one tree produces the same bytes, because a timestamp
  would turn a diff between two manifests into a diff between two runs. Same
  rule here: `fingerprint a.json a.json` is stable across runs and machines, and
  `diff` reports a difference in INPUTS, never in time. The record carries
  `written_at` for a human; nothing hashes it.

ONE PROCESS, ONE PARSE

  `manifest` hashes every declared input in THIS process. The obvious bash
  spelling is `for f in $inputs; do shasum "$f"; done`, which is one process
  per input file — and P0-2's finding is that the fleet's cost is process spawn,
  not work. So the loop here is a loop over bytes, in one interpreter, and the
  number of files in a declaration changes the number of `read()` calls rather
  than the number of processes.

THE SKIP IS THREE CONJUNCTS, AND THE SECOND ONE IS THE ONE PEOPLE FORGET

  moon skips only when `exit_code == 0 && hash matches &&
  has_previous_outputs_been_created(&previous_globs_hash)`. The second conjunct
  is the whole packet: a matching fingerprint whose outputs have been deleted is
  NOT a hit. A cache that returns green for work it did not do is worse than no
  cache, because no cache is at least honest about having done nothing.

  `output_paths_hash` is moon's `hash_output_globs`: a sha256 over the sorted
  list of RELATIVE PATHS the output globs currently match — not over their
  contents, because the question is "is the same set of files still there", and
  hashing contents would make every cache hit a re-hash of every output.

EXIT CODES. Four distinct outcomes and none of them is "crash".

  0  HIT        the record is valid, the fingerprint matches, exit was 0, and
                the declared outputs are still present in the same set. The
                recorded stdout is printed on stdout so the CALLER can replay it:
                a later caller reads the record instead of re-deriving (P0-1).
  1  MISS       no record, or a different fingerprint, or the recorded exit was
                not 0, or an output is gone. The caller runs the check.
  2  CORRUPT    a record exists and cannot be trusted: unreadable, not JSON, a
                field of the wrong type, or its `fingerprint` field does not
                match the manifest it claims to describe. The caller runs the
                check. It is deliberately NOT 1 and NOT 0: a corrupt record that
                reported MISS would be indistinguishable from a cold cache in
                the logs, which is how a broken cache stays broken for a month.
  3  FOREIGN    the record's `schema` or `tool` is not one this build honours.
                The caller runs the check, and says so. Refusing is the point:
                honouring a record written by a different kit means honouring a
                verdict about a check that may no longer exist.

  Every non-zero is "run the check". Nothing here can turn a check green; the
  most this file can do is hand back a verdict some earlier run already reached,
  and every conjunct of that is checked first.
