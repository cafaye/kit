#   bash tests/kamal_test.sh
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHY IT RUNS THE REAL BINARIES
#
#   `config/deploy.yml` and `config/kamal-backup.yml` are two files a service
#   copies, and every rule in this repository about parse-what-you-hand-out
#   applies to them. A `yaml.safe_load` on either one would be the same weak
#   check the rest of this project has already rejected once: it says the file is
#   YAML, and nothing about whether Kamal can use it.
#
#   Three defects in this file's own history are the argument for running the
#   binaries, and none of them is a YAML syntax error:
#
#     1. `image: ghcr.io/org/repo` alongside `registry.server: ghcr.io` is valid
#        YAML, and resolves to `ghcr.io/ghcr.io/org/repo`. Measured: `kamal
#        config` reports the doubled host. A parse check is green; the deploy
#        fails at the push.
#     2. A missing `builder.arch` is valid YAML. `kamal` refuses the config
#        outright ("builder: Builder arch not set"), because a wrong
#        architecture surfaces as an exec-format error at run time.
#     3. A secret named in `config/kamal-backup.yml` but missing from the
#        backup accessory's `env.secret` list in `config/deploy.yml` is valid
#        YAML in BOTH files, and each file is internally consistent.
#        `kamal-backup validate` rejects the pair ("RESTIC_REPOSITORY or
#        RESTIC_REPOSITORY_FILE is required") because it builds the accessory
#        environment from the deploy config alone. A per-file parse cannot see
#        a cross-file contract; this test is the only thing that can.
#
#   So: the real `kamal` renders and resolves the deploy config, and the real
#   `kamal-backup` validates the pair. Both are offline and need no docker, no
#   SSH and no credentials — every secret is a throwaway value in a
#   throwaway process's environment, and the assertion is that the value never
#   reaches a file.
#
# WHAT IS AND IS NOT PROVEN HERE
#   Proven: the two files are accepted by the tools that consume them, the ERB
#   renders, every variable a rendered value depends on is required rather than
#   silently empty, the two files agree about secrets, and the drill refuses a
#   production-looking scratch database.
#   NOT proven: that a real deploy works, that a real backup runs, or that a
#   real restore succeeds. Those need a host, credentials and a database. The
#   claim this file makes is the narrow one, and it is the one a template can
#   silently lose.

# "5432:5432" and hands it to `docker run --publish`, and Docker binds 0.0.0.0
# and :: when no host address is given, so the database lands on every interface
# the host has. Measured: a boot with the line fails with `Bind for 0.0.0.0:5432
# failed` when something else holds 5432, which is Docker naming the bind.
#
# Neither the loopback alternative nor a firewall is the fix, and the loopback one
# does not even work for the application: a container on the `kamal` network has
# its own 127.0.0.1, so `port: "127.0.0.1:5432:5432"` makes the database
# unreachable FROM THE APP while reducing its exposure. The app reaches the
# accessory by container name over that network, with nothing published.
#
# This is the case for which this test file's whole argument applies. A per-file
# grep for "port:" would pass on a template that publishes postgres and fail on one
# that publishes a port the service needs, and it would say nothing about what
# kamal RESOLVES. So it reads the resolved document, the way the retention
# assertions above read the template, and the two are different claims about
