# kit's proof that the redaction boundary holds, against a REAL collector.
#
#   bash tests/canary_test.sh
#
# THE CLAIM
#   "Prompt and completion content must never appear in a telemetry span."
#   (core/schemas/telemetry/redaction.schema.json, `default: "deny"`)
#
#   Every other proof of this in the fleet is a STATIC assertion over an
#   allowlist: kit's gate compares the collector's `allowed_keys` to core's
#   schemas, and muse asserts its own `ALLOWED_SPAN_ATTRIBUTES` over a rendered
#   span. Those are necessary and they are not sufficient. A key-name check
#   proves the names somebody already thought of are absent, and the realistic
#   way this leaks is a name nobody predicted — a well-meaning `muse.prompt`
#   added in six months by someone debugging a routing decision, not an
#   attacker.
#
#   So this test plants a canary string in every shape a leak could take and
#   asserts it appears in NOTHING that left the collector:
#
#     a banned key            (`llm.prompt`)       the obvious one
#     an SDK-default key      (`error.message`)    shipped by every SDK
#     the exception form      (`exception.message`) the migration path
#     a near-miss key         (`llm.prompt_sha256`) the sneaky one
#     an allowed key          (`http.route`)       the important one
#     a resource attribute    (`service.secret`)   the one nobody checks
#     a credential VALUE under an allowed key — blocked_values, not the allowlist
#     a metric data point     the label, not the span
#     a log record attribute
#     a log record BODY       — reported, not asserted. See below.
#
#   And it asserts the ALLOWED data survived, which is the half that is easy to
#   fake: a collector that drops everything passes a "no canary" test and is
#   useless. If `error.type`, `http.route` and a resource `tenant_id` do not
#   arrive, the boundary is not enforcing a policy, it is deleting the data.
#
# THE LOG BODY IS DELIBERATELY NOT ASSERTED, and this is the one thing a reader
# must not get wrong. The body is the one place free text is EXPECTED — core's
# log schema requires it and bounds it at 2048 characters — and the redaction
# processor is specified over ATTRIBUTES, so a body is neither scrubbed nor
# claimed to be. The test says so out loud rather than quietly passing, because
# a reader who assumes the body is scrubbed is exactly the reader who puts a
# prompt in one.
#
# HOUSE PATTERN
#   muse/tests/test_trace_propagation.py, which places a canary in both the
#   prompt and the completion and asserts it appears nowhere in the rendered
#   span payload, SEPARATELY from the key-name check so that truncation cannot
#   be what makes it pass. The `http.route` case is that separation: the key is
#   allowlisted so it survives, and the canary in its VALUE is the only thing
#   standing between a working pipeline and a silent pass.
#
# THE CONFIG UNDER TEST
#   The shipped `templates/compose/otel-collector.yml`, with its three exporters
#   mechanically replaced by a `file` exporter. Built by substitution, never
#   maintained as a second copy: a second copy of the redaction config is a
#   second place for the allowlist to drift, and the allowlist is the thing this
#   test exists to check. The redaction processors, their order, the transform
#   and the spanmetrics connector are all the shipped ones, unmodified.
#
# NO SLEEPS. Every wait is a poll on a health or content signal with a deadline.
# A sleep is a guess about someone else's flush interval, and it is wrong on the
# machine where it matters.

#   comma-joined list of the key NAMES it removed. The canary's key names are
#   therefore in the capture and the canary's key VALUES are not, because the
#   attributes are gone before the summary is written. The first version of
#   this test read those names as a leak and reported four failures that were
#   in fact the receipt working: "the key name appears" is not "the key
#   survived", and conflating them makes the summary a false positive.
