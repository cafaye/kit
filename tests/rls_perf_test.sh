# tests/rls_perf_test.sh — P1-24: the policy JOIN DIRECTION, measured on a real
# cluster, and asserted as a number rather than described in a report.
#
# WHAT IT MEASURES. The packet's two shapes, on kit's own identity seam
# (`cafaye.begin_account` / `cafaye.current_account_id`), against a membership
# table indexed in BOTH directions:
#
#   SLOW  using ((select cafaye.current_account_id()) in
#                (select m.caller_account from member_of m
#                   where m.subject_account = doc.subject_account_id))
#          -- the membership subquery is CORRELATED to the policy's own row.
#
#   FAST  using (doc.subject_account_id in
#                (select m.subject_account from member_of m
#                   where m.caller_account = (select cafaye.current_account_id())))
#          -- membership resolved once into a set; IN against the ROW COLUMN.
#
#   KIT   using (account_id = (select cafaye.current_account_id()))
#          -- what protect_table writes. No membership table, so no join either way.
#
#   EDGE  the same delegation reachable only through a link table, so the OUTER
#         hop has no local membership column to invert. This is the boundary the
#         packet asks to be written down, and it is measured rather than asserted.
#
# FOUR ASSERTIONS, and each is one a wrong implementation fails:
#
#   1. All four shapes return the SAME row count. The three delegation forms
#      compute one predicate over one membership table keyed
#      (caller, subject), so a disagreement is a fixture bug — and a check that
#      only compared timings would happily report a 100x win for a predicate that
#      returns nothing.
#   2. SLOW is at least 10x SLOWER than FAST. The direction of the effect is the
#      claim; the constant is not, and a fixture too small to separate them would
#      fail this rather than pass it by noise.
#   3. FAST's membership subquery is evaluated ONCE (`loops=1`) and SLOW's is
#      evaluated once per candidate row (`loops` = the row count). This is the
#      MECHANISM, asserted separately from the timing, because a number that moves
#      with machine load and a number that is a loop counter fail for different
#      reasons and only one of them is a bug.
#   4. The EDGE case resolves its membership ONCE even though its outer hop is
#      correlated — because the INNER hop is inverted and Postgres can then
#      re-associate the EXISTS into a semi-join. That is the finding, and it is
#      the reason the rule shipped in advisor.sql targets `IN (correlated)` and not
#      correlation in general.
#
# IT SKIPS LOUDLY without docker, like tests/tenancy_test.sh and
# tests/isolation_test.sh: exit 3, one sentence naming what is missing.
#
# THE IMAGE IS `postgres:<tag>`, the base kit's Dockerfile builds FROM, and NOT
# kit's built cluster image. The measurement is about the planner, not about the
# pglayers extension, and building the full image needs ghcr.io; a perf gate that
# silently skips whenever a registry is slow is a gate nobody trusts. The tag is
# read out of templates/compose/postgres/Dockerfile rather than written here, for
# the reason tests/isolation_test.sh gives about the pgvector pin.
