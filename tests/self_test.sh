# kit's proof that `tests/validate.sh` is able to fail.

#
# WHAT THIS IS FOR
#   A gate that only ever goes green is a report, not a gate. This script copies
#   the tree to a throwaway directory, breaks it once per kind of check, and
#   asserts the gate goes RED each time. Each breakage must be caught by a
#   *different* check, so a passing self_test means the checks are independent
#   and not one lucky assertion standing in for all of them.
#
# THE EIGHTY BREAKAGES, and one GREEN control (20 from the tier work, 21
#                               from the fan-out work, 24-26 from the fleet gate,
#                               27-32c from the lint work, 33-40 from the
#                               staleness/parity work, 41-51 from the secrets
#                               work, 52-60 from the fetched-stack work, 61-62
#                               from the licence, 68-74 from the shared-cluster
#                               work, 75 from the rename that disarmed the
#                               fleet check, 76-77 from the bin/dev commands the
#                               documentation promises, 78-79 from the second
#                               callable standard, 89 from the `options:` key
#                               that took the fleet's CI down for two days
#                               without a red check; 18 shared before the
#                               lint packet)
#   1. delete a language template   -> the artifact-presence check goes red
#   68. .env.example's Postgres tag disagrees with compose's default -> the
#        agreement check goes red. This is the defect that SHIPPED: the stack
#        ran 16.6 on every developer's machine while the compose file, the
#        README and the CHANGELOG all said 17, and commit 48689e6 fixed the
#        compose file and left the file that overrides it alone.
#   69. the tag is switched back to an alpine variant -> red, because pgvector
#        is a glibc-linked layer and does not load on musl.
#   70. the init script is never mounted -> red. Nothing reports a cluster with
#        one database and no per-service roles except this.
#   71. the connection budget set below what the topology needs -> red.
#   72. a generated config stops setting `application_name` -> red.
#   73. a generated config carries a POOLER WORKAROUND -> red. The invisible
#        one: `prepare: :unnamed` on a fleet with no pooler is slower and looks
#        correct, so this list is the only way anyone finds out.
#   74. `DECISIONS.md` deleted -> red. Seven places reference it; it did not
#        exist until this packet, so nothing had ever checked.
#   75. a service runs its own postgres IMAGE, with no published port for
#        another check to report -> red. The regression this packet's own
#        earlier commit shipped: making the cluster a BUILT image renamed kit's
#        from `postgres` to `kit-postgres`, which silently disarmed the fleet
#        check that names a service running its own copy of the platform.
#   76. `bin/dev` stops dispatching a command four files tell the reader to run
#        -> red. `bin/dev db grant` was documented in four places and did not
#        exist.
#   77. `bin/dev` keeps the command but loses the SUBCOMMAND -> red. The harder
#        half: a check that only asks "is `db` dispatched" is green here.
#   78. a COPY of a declared standard parked at another path -> red. The
#        original defect, still caught after kit-32 widened the check.
#   79. a callable workflow at a path kit does not DECLARE -> red. The new one:
#        the widening must exempt declared paths and nothing else, or it has
#        stopped being a check.
#   2. add a collector exporter    -> the privacy check goes red
#   2b. DELETE the tempo exporter   -> the same check goes red from the other
#        side. A set difference only catches the extra; this catches the
#        missing, which is the mistake that ships a stack that collects
#        everything and prints it.
#   3. corrupt the python codec    -> the executed test suite goes red
#   4. hardcode a compose port     -> the parameterization check goes red
#   5. flip the CI input default   -> the "consumers stay green" check goes red
#   6. ungate the `none` job       -> the option/job agreement check goes red
#   7-10. break the agreement between the documented `uses:` string and the
#         real path, in the four ways it can break -> the callable-path check
#         goes red
#   11-12. break a Dockerfile -> the hadolint check, and the non-root check that
#         exists because hadolint has no rule for a missing USER
#   13-18. one semantic mutation per language implementation -> THAT language's
#         suite goes red. A suite that has never failed has never been proven to
#         test anything, and six suites that only one language's mutation covers
#         is five suites that might assert nothing at all.
#   19. an allowlist entry that matches nothing -> the unused-entry check goes
#         red. This is the sharpest property kit owns, and it is the one with
#         the most room to be decorative: an allowlist rule that has never
#         rejected anything is a comment in a file with a `.gitignore`-shaped
#         name. Modelled on ESLint's reportUnusedDisableDirectives, which
#         reports a disable comment that no longer suppresses anything —
#         without that rule a skip list is a ratchet that only turns one way,
#         and within two quarters it contains every test in the repository.
#
#   Breakages 2 and 4 were both REWRITTEN in kit-03, for the same reason and it
#   is worth recording: their recipes named strings that no longer exist. 2
#   mutated `exporters: [debug]`, which the traces pipeline stopped being when
#   it began fanning out to three backends; 4 replaced a literal
#   `${KIT_POSTGRES_PORT:-5432}`, which stopped existing when the stack moved
#   into kit's 15000-15999 port block. In both cases `edit` refused to apply the
#   mutation — correct behaviour, since a stale recipe must not silently pass —
#   and the gate went red on that breakage and never reached the next one. A
#   self_test whose recipe no longer applies is a self_test that has stopped
#   testing the thing it names.
#   20. nest `includePaths` under `git:` -> the core fan-out check goes red. The
#         shape reads correctly, syncs successfully, and vendors the entire
#         upstream repository; it was run before it was written down.
#   21. make the change classifier FAIL OPEN -> classify_test.sh goes red. This
#         is the sharpest proof here: it inverts the fail-closed property and
#         asserts the suite notices, so the property is a counterexample rather
#         than a claim in a comment.
#   22. report an undeclared core pin as `current` -> staleness_test.sh goes red.
#         Two real repositories are in that state today, which is what makes the
#         difference between `undeclared` and `current` load-bearing.
#   23. delete the interpreter floor from validate.sh -> with a stub ruby older
#         than KitOtel::RUBY_FLOOR on PATH, the ruby suite goes red under its
#         own label. This is the red that three landed-or-landing packets were
#         blocked by, reproduced on purpose.
#  23b. the floor INTACT, same old stub -> the gate stays GREEN and names the
#         skip. The one breakage here that asserts a check while the gate is
#         green: a floor that turns a red into a silent pass is worse than no
#         floor, and only this direction can tell the two apart.
#  24-26. the shapes a workaround for a FIXED core defect takes -> the fleet
#         check goes red. Two are D12 (core 63fd319: `RUN_KEY` could not see a
#         one-line `run:`) and one is D13 (core c63af27: a proof matched against
#         bytes still carrying ANSI colour). Both defects are fixed, so a
#         workaround for either is a second, unversioned copy of a decision that
#         now lives in core, and 26's escape runs make the declaration WEAKER
#         than the same declaration written without them.

# 27-30. the four ways the "lint runs from kit" mechanism stops being a GATE
#         while everything else stays green, all caught by `lint_wiring_check`
#         and all NAMING it, because a check that has quietly stopped being
#         load-bearing should fail here rather than being found months later by
#         the policy it stopped policing:
#           27. a language job's `lint` step DELETED -> the job no longer lints
#           28. that step made ADVISORY — `continue-on-error: true`, the
#                breakage that matters most, because the step still runs, still
#                prints every finding, and the job is green. A linter that only
#                warns is a report, and this is how a report is born without
#                anybody deciding to write one.
#           28b. the same defect written the other way it can be written,
#                `|| true` at the end of the run body. Continue-on-error in
#                shell, and it reads to nobody as anything but a deliberate
#                choice.
#           29. the kit CHECKOUT deleted, so `--config` names a file that is not
#                there and each linter quietly falls back to its own defaults —
#                five linters for golangci-lint, MethodLength 10 for rubocop,
#                no rules at all for eslint. All green, all much weaker, and
#                invisible in the YAML, because the step still says `--config`.
#           30. the config WEAKENED in place. The sharpest of the four, because
#                every other check can be green while it happens: the file still
#                parses, the workflow still points at it, and the policy is now
#                whatever was left. So the linter list is asserted BY VALUE.
#  31. a SERVICE carries a lint config INCONSISTENT with kit's -> the drift
#        check goes red. The failure this whole packet exists to end, at the
#        layer where it lands: a service's own lint config, disagreeing with
#        kit's, in a repository that calls kit.
#
#        The MECHANISM was measured before it was written down, and the first
#        version of this comment was wrong. `--config` WINS: `golangci-lint run
#        -v` prints exactly one `[config_reader] Used config file`, and with the
#        flag it names kit's — a repo-root `.golangci.yml` that disables
#        `misspell` does not survive it, and RuboCop behaves the same way. So a
#        stale copy does NOT hijack kit's CI, and this breakage is not about
#        that. What a copy does is SPLIT the policy: every other invocation in
#        that repository reads it while CI reads kit's, and it becomes live
#        again the instant the flag is lost — silently, because a copy is always
#        weaker than the thing it was copied from. That is the finding, and it is
#        why the check reports the DIFFERENCE rather than banning the file.
# 32-32c. the SEAM, in the three ways `lint_args_seam_check` can stop being a
#         control. The seam is `lint-args`, the one input a service uses to ask
#         for a stricter linter, and its narrowness is a list of refused flags
#         held in a `lint-args guard` step in each lint job:
#           32. the guard DELETED from one job. The other two keep working, so
#                this is the shape of an accident — one merge, one job, no other
#                signal anywhere.
#           32b. the guard KEPT and its list SHORTENED by one token. The edit a
#                well-meaning commit makes when somebody wants `--no-config`:
#                rather than argue about the seam, the token comes out. The
#                build stays green for every service that sets it and the
#                workflow still contains a step called `lint-args guard`. This
#                is the sharpest of the three, and it is only caught because the
#                token list is asserted against a copy held in validate.sh.
#           32c. the guard MOVED after the linter. It still runs, still reads the
#                variable, and still refuses everything it refused — after the
#                linter has been handed `--no-config` and already exited 0. A
#                control that runs after the thing it controls is the most
#                comfortable kind of dead code, because read top to bottom it
#                looks exactly like a live one.
#   ...and one GREEN control, which is the other half of 31's claim: a service
#        config that AGREES with kit's must PASS, because a check that failed on
#        the mere presence of the file would train every service to delete a file
#        it is allowed to keep. It is written here as prose rather than as a
#        numbered entry because it is a control and not a breakage — and because
#        `self_test_claims` counts only the red-expecting helpers, so a numbered
#        entry here would be reported as a header claim with no recipe.

#  33. a parity-allowlist entry naming an artefact kit does not ship -> the
#         dead-entry check goes red. The ESLint direction, and the mutation is
#         well-formed in every other respect, so a shape-only check passes it.
#  34. an EXPIRED parity-allowlist entry -> the same check goes red. The gate
#         reads the clock, and this is the first time anything in kit has
#         actually watched the ratchet fire rather than reading that it exists.
#  35. `tests/artifacts.json` naming a `{lang}` source kit does not ship for
#         every language -> the artefact-table check goes red. Half a language is
#         worse than none, and the table is what says so.
#  36. report an ABSENT artefact as `current` -> staleness_test.sh goes red.
#         This is the breakage the packet is for: the reporter treating the
#         commonest state in the fleet as the one that means everything is fine.
#  37. grade a copy by RESEMBLANCE rather than by equality -> staleness_test.sh
#         goes red. The failure mode the packet names: a file that looks like
#         kit's is not evidence it is kit's.
#  38. give one of the two programs a third-party import -> the carve-out check
#         goes red. "Standard library only" was a sentence in AGENTS.md for the
#         whole life of the rule and nothing checked it; a boundary nobody can
#         cross is not a boundary.
#  39. remove one fixture service's `.git`, so the reporter cannot see it ->
#         staleness_test.sh goes red AND blames the FIXTURE. Observed for real at
#         load average 160 before it was written: one case failed, 35 passed, and
#         the failure text named the reporter when the reporter had simply been
#         handed a smaller fleet. A red that misattributes itself is worse than
#         no red, so this asserts the EXPLANATION, not only the exit status.
#  40. delete the one line that consults the ruby toolchain floor, leaving the
#         probe defined and never called -> the ruby check still runs the suite.
#         A floor check that is written, admired and never fires is the shape
#         this breakage is the well-intentioned version of: `have ruby` is three
#         lines above, so asking whether it is the RIGHT ruby looks redundant.
#         `Array#filter_map` is a runtime call, so without the floor an old
#         interpreter reports three NoMethodErrors and the summary blames a
#         template that is correct.
#
# 41-42. plant a detectable credential, in history and in the working tree ->
#            the secret scanner goes red
# 43-44. remove --redact, then narrow the scan to the last commit -> the
#            scanner's BEHAVIOUR check goes red. Not its source: a `grep -- --redact`
#            is satisfied by the comment above the flag that explains why the flag
#            is mandatory, and that breakage proved exactly that
# 45. add `pull_request_target` -> the dangerous-trigger check goes red
# 46. make the `secrets` job `continue-on-error` -> the not-advisory check goes
#            red. A secret scanner that only warns is a report
# 47-50. break the canary's reference type in the four ways that turn it into
#            the leaky one -> THAT VECTOR's suite goes red
# 51. baseline unpinned-uses in .github/zizmor.yml -> the never-baselined check
#            goes red

# 52-55. THE FLEET GATE, one breakage per failure mode, each against a FIXTURE
#         fleet rather than the real one. A fixture fleet is what makes these
#         mean anything: the real fleet is red on master BY DESIGN, so "the gate
#         went red" there is satisfied by two clean repositories.
#           52. a service carrying its own copy of the shared stack (a second
#               postgres) -> the stale-copy check goes red. Five of the six
#               repositories that declare local infrastructure are in exactly
#               this state today, and the mutation is their real shape rather
#               than a toy.
#           53. a service that overrides the collector's config mount -> the
#               weakened-boundary check goes red. The mount is where the
#               redaction allowlist lives, so this is the failure that leaks
#               prompt content rather than the one that looks untidy.
#           54. an `otel-collector.yml` nothing ever starts -> the dead-config
#               check goes red. Inert is the worst of the four: the file looks
#               authoritative, every edit to it changes nothing, and a
#               developer has no way to find out.
#           55. a `kit.ref` holding `master` -> the pin check goes red.
# 56-58. the override rules, each against the named check.
#           56. a vendor config mount that stopped resolving from the fetched
#               tree. Found by RUNNING the stack; `docker compose config`
#               renders the same project and every other check stays green.
#           57. the pin moved back into `.env`, where it is git-ignored and so
#               exists on exactly one machine.
#           58. a service publishes a port on a service kit already ships. The
#               merge appends rather than substitutes, so nothing errors and the
#               port the developer meant to move is still bound.
# 59-60. THE ADOPTION CEILING, both sides of it, because a ceiling that only has
#         one side proved is not a ceiling — it is a deleted check.
#           59. the SAME stale copy in a repository with NO `kit.ref` -> the gate
#               stays GREEN and the finding is printed as a WARN naming the
#               adoption path. This is the half that could have been quietly
#               wrong: if the unadopted side went red, the ceiling would not
#               exist and this breakage would have caught it.
#           60. that repository's `kit.ref` written -> the gate goes RED on the
#               same defect, same message, same severity. This is the half that
#               proves nothing was weakened: it is the fixture of breakage 52
#               plus one committed line.
#           The pair is also the ratchet proof. 59 and 60 run over the SAME
#           fixture, so a change that softened the adopted side fails 60 and a
#           change that hardened the unadopted side fails 59, and there is no
#           third state in which both pass and the checks are weaker.
# 83. A SERVICE OVERRIDING THE SHARED CLUSTER'S OWN POSTGRES IDENTITY -> the
#         weakened-boundary check goes red, naming the override.
#         The one breakage here whose defect was kit's own ADVICE. For years
#         `check_stale_copy` and the adoption-path block both told a service to
#         "override the postgres service's environment (POSTGRES_DB /
#         POSTGRES_USER)", and that sentence is the whole defect: the official
#         image creates `POSTGRES_USER` as a SUPERUSER, so the override makes
#         the overriding service a cluster superuser; and the image has already
#         created that role and database, so `CREATE ROLE` / `CREATE DATABASE`
#         in `initdb/10-cluster.sh` fail during initdb and the whole cluster
#         refuses to start. Measured both ways; see `_SHARED_CLUSTER_ENV`.
#         `identity` carries the override, inherited from following it, and it
#         was found by a worker doing an unrelated migration.
#
#         It is a breakage in this family and not a new section because
#         correcting the prose alone would have left the gap open from the other
#         side: a service that FOLLOWS the corrected advice deletes its own
#         postgres service, which is precisely the thing `check_stale_copy`
#         stops reporting. Advice and predicate have to move together or the
#         fix walks into a check that no longer sees it.
#
#         The mutation is `POSTGRES_USER` alone, and that choice is the red
#         proof rather than a shorthand. All three keys fire, but `POSTGRES_USER`
#         is the one with BOTH failure modes, and it is the one a real service
#         carries. `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` is the interesting exclusion: it breaks
#         neither the cluster nor the boundary, and asserting on it would have
#         meant asserting on the part of the check that is least like the thing
#         it was written for.
#
#         The needle is the finding's own wording, and `check_override_surface`
#         is named in the label, because a red from the ports rule or the
#         stale-copy rule would satisfy a weaker assertion. The fixture carries
#         `POSTGRES_DB: alpha` on `alpha:` — a service setting the variable on
#         its OWN service, which is the legitimate case — so the check also
#         proves it stays quiet about that, on every fixture recipe in this
#         file, without a separate control.
# 78-82. THE KAMAL CONFIG, which is the one place kit generates YAML that a
#         THIRD-PARTY BINARY has to accept. Everything else kit hands out is
#         read by the service's own toolchain; this is read by `kamal` and
#         `kamal-backup`, so a template can be valid YAML, parse cleanly, and
#         still be a config neither tool will take.
#
#         RENUMBERED, and the header was not moved with it. This block read
#         `61-65` and described these five at 61, 62, 63, 64 and 65; the recipes
#         were renumbered to 78-82 (4a037f3, whose own body note records the
#         collision that forced the move) and this header was left behind. The
#         damage was not cosmetic and not confined to this block: 61 and 62 were
#         REUSED, and by the LICENCE breakages below, which really do exist.
#         So the header claimed two different sets of proofs under the same two
#         numbers, and `self_test_claims` — which exists precisely to catch a
#         block of prose drifting from the recipes — reported both directions at
#         once: "header documents breakage 63 but no recipe carries it" and
#         "recipe proves breakage 78 but the header does not document it". Six
#         findings from one unrenumbered comment, on master, with the integrity
#         check itself being the thing that found it.
#           78. the generated deploy.yml made INVALID for kamal -> the
#                kamal_test check goes red. `builder.arch` is the mutation
#                because it is a real one: removing it is valid YAML, and kamal
#                refuses the file outright ("Builder arch not set").
#           79. the image name given the registry host it already has ->
#                kamal_test goes red. The sharpest of the five, and the one no
#                parse check could ever have caught: `image: ghcr.io/org/repo`
#                with `registry.server: ghcr.io` resolves to
#                `ghcr.io/ghcr.io/org/repo`. Both files are valid, `kamal
#                config` exits 0, and the deploy fails at the push.
#           80. one kamal/ artifact DELETED -> the presence check goes red.
#                Half a set is worse than none, and here the two configs are one
#                contract rather than two files.
#           81. the superseded custom backup toolchain RESTORED -> the
#                must-be-gone check goes red. The only breakage here that is
#                about something being PRESENT, and it exists because "we
#                removed it" is a claim with no mechanical form until something
#                asserts the absence.
#           82. the drill's refusal of a production-looking scratch name WEAKENED
#                -> kamal_test goes red. The safety property, mutated the way a
#                well-meaning commit would mutate it: the `*prod*` pattern
#                narrowed so the common names still match and the awkward one
#                does not.
#
#   ...and one GREEN control for the Kamal work, 78b: an UNMODIFIED tree's
#        generated config must PASS kamal and kamal-backup. Every other recipe
#        here proves a check can go red; this proves the thing they are all
#        measured against actually works, which is the half that decays without
#        a symptom. It is written as prose rather than numbered because
#        `self_test_claims` counts only the red-expecting helpers.
#
# 84-87. THE SHARED CLUSTER, and specifically the two defects that meant no
#         service in the fleet ever had a database on it while reporting itself
#         healthy. Prose for these lives with the recipes, far below and out of
#         this header, because they were added long after the numbers were first
#         laid out; the entry is here only so the set agrees. 83 is NOT in this
#         block and 84-87 do not include it: kit-29 claimed 83 for the
#         superuser-override check in a different worktree, and two packets
#         numbering a breakage the same way is precisely what makes this header
#         unable to say which recipe a line describes.
#
#         87 is the fourth because removing the `:-` fallback from
#         `KIT_POSTGRES_DATABASES` — which is what 84-86 exist to insist on —
#         turned out to break kit's OWN live harness, and 214 static checks and
#         86 proofs did not notice. So the rule now covers kit's own harnesses
#         too, statically, and 87 is the proof that it does.
#
# 88. THE SECOND TENANT, which is the case every other breakage in this file
#         structurally cannot reach. All of them prove that ONE service gets a
#         database; this is the first to ask what happens when a second name is
#         appended, and it exists because that question had never been asked and
#         the answer was wrong. `KIT_POSTGRES_DATABASES="billing neighbour"`
#         provisioned ONE database named `billingneighbour` and reported
#         success, because a `tr -d '[:space:]'` standing in front of
#         `require_identifier` deleted the space before the validator could
#         refuse it. Measured on a live cluster, not inferred.
#
#         It gets its own number rather than joining 84-87 above because that
#         block is about the cluster provisioning NOTHING, and this is about it
#         provisioning the wrong THING while reporting itself healthy. Different
#         defect, different fix — and a header number that covers two of those
#         is a number that cannot say which recipe a line describes.
#
# 89. THE REUSABLE WORKFLOW'S OWN SCHEMA, which every service inherits by CALLING
#         it rather than copying it — which is the property that makes one bad
#         input here a fleet-wide outage rather than a local bug. `workflow_call`
#         inputs do not accept an `options:` block the way `workflow_dispatch`
#         inputs do, and GitHub rejects the FILE for it: not a warning on one
#         input, but a workflow that will not load at all, so every service that
#         calls it fails before a single job starts.
#
# 61-62. THE LICENCE, in the two ways the grant stops being unambiguous. A
#         licence is only unambiguous when exactly ONE place in a repository can
#         declare one.
#           61. `LICENSE` DELETED -> the licence check goes red. cafaye's
#               decision is MIT across the fleet, and a repository with no grant
#               is not permissive: it is all rights reserved, the default
#               copyright position when nothing is granted. The README kept
#               saying MIT the whole time, which is exactly why this needed a
#               check — the documentation was true and the repository was not.
#           62. a root `package.json` declaring `AGPL-3.0-only` -> the same check
#               goes red, with `LICENSE` and the README both still saying MIT.
#               This is the direction nobody looks at, and it is the one that
#               makes the check real: a check asserting only that `LICENSE`
#               exists is satisfied by a repository that has acquired a THIRD
#               statement about its own grant, which a compliance tool reads.
#
#   33-40 continue that numbering above, and the reason the copy-is-gone case
#   gets TWO breakages and not one is that
#   "report absent as current" and "grade by resemblance" are opposite mistakes
#   that a single mutation cannot both produce: one removes a finding, the
#   other invents one, and a gate that can only do one of them is half a gate.
#
#   Forty-seven of them (7-12, 19, 20, 24-32c, 33-35, 38, 40-62) additionally
#         assert WHICH check went red. Every other breakage only proves the gate
#         can fail; those prove the check written for that defect is still
#         load-bearing, which is a different claim and the one that decays
#         silently. 21, 22, 36 and 37 assert the same thing about the two scripts
#         that are themselves proofs, 39 asserts it about the WORDING — a red that
#         blames the reporter when the fixture is at fault is a red that sends
#         the next reader to the wrong file — 52-55 and 58-60 assert it over
#         a FIXTURE fleet rather than over the tree (see `fixture_fleet` below
#         for why that helper exists at all), and 61-62 assert it over the
#         licence, where the named check is the only thing distinguishing
#         "the grant is gone" from "something else went red".
#
#   And one GREEN control, which is a claim the numbered breakages cannot make.
#         31b asserts the gate is green on a copy whose service config MATCHES
#         kit's. A check that failed on the mere presence of a `.golangci.yml`
#         would be satisfied by this packet and would teach every service to
#         delete a file it is allowed to keep — a silent outcome, and a worse one
#         than the drift it was written to catch.
#
#   The counts here were wrong three times and every time a check caught it
#         rather than a reader: the header said "seven" over a four-wide range,
#         it numbered a second entry 19 while the recipes numbered it 20, and it
#         kept saying "twenty-three" after the lint packet added six more. A
#         header that drifts from the recipes is not documentation, it is a
#         second, unchecked copy of the truth — which is the entire thing
#         validate.sh's header/recipe check exists to prevent. That check COUNTS
#         the recipes and diffs them against this header, so the third error was
#         caught the same way as the first two: mechanically, not by reading.
#
# WHAT IT IS NOT
#   This is not exhaustive mutation testing. Each implementation gets exactly one
#   mutant, chosen to be the bug a reviewer would not see: a dropped bit mask, an
#   alphabet that quietly grows a second case, a limit raised until it never
#   fires. One mutant per language proves the suite bites; it does not prove the
#   suite is complete, and nothing here should be read as claiming that is.
#
#   The same applies to breakages 41-51. They prove each check CAN fail; they do
#   not prove the check is complete. A check that fires on the defect it was
#   written for is the floor, and the floor is what a gate nobody runs has.
#
# WHY THE PLANTED PROBES ARE ASSEMBLED RATHER THAN WRITTEN OUT
#   Breakage 24 plants a credential, 25 plants the same one, and 33 plants a
#   canary literal. All three are assembled from parts in a throwaway copy, for
#   one reason: a probe written out is a probe committed, and the scanner and the
#   canary check would then both report THIS FILE — every breakage caught by the
#   wrong thing, and a gate that is red for a reason nobody introduced.
#
#   It happened, twice, while writing these. `tests/validate.sh` reported four
#   leaks in the file that was planting them, and the canary check reported the
#   breakage's own replacement string. Both are recorded in the breakages'
#   comments, because a proof that only ever worked the first time is a proof
#   somebody will trust.


#   These are numbered 20-22 rather than 19-21 because 19 is the allowlist
#   breakage above, from the tier work. Both packets numbered their first entry
#   independently and the collision is only visible in the union — which is what
#   the header/recipe check in validate.sh is for.
#
#   Eight of them (7-10, 11, 12, 19, 20) additionally assert WHICH check went
#         red. Every other breakage only proves the gate can fail; those prove
#         the check written for that defect is still load-bearing, which is a
#         different claim and the one that decays silently. 21 and 22 assert the
#         same thing about the two scripts that are themselves proofs.
#
#   The counts here were wrong twice and both times a check caught it rather
#   than a reader: the header said "seven" over a four-wide range, and it
#   numbered a second entry 19 while the recipes numbered it 20. A header that
#   drifts from the recipes is not documentation, it is a second, unchecked copy
#   of the truth — which is the entire thing validate.sh's header/recipe check
#         exists to prevent.
#
# WHAT IT IS NOT
#   This is not exhaustive mutation testing. Each implementation gets exactly one
#   mutant, chosen to be the bug a reviewer would not see: a dropped bit mask, an

# A fresh throwaway copy per breakage: one breakage must never mask the next,
# and no breakage may touch the worktree this script was invoked from.
#
# EACH COPY GETS ITS OWN PARENT DIRECTORY, and that is load-bearing rather than
# tidiness. `fleet_repos` in tests/validate.sh finds a service fleet by globbing
# `$ROOT/..`, so a copy that sat directly in the shared `$WORK` would see all
# THIRTY of its siblings as the fleet. That is not a tidiness problem, it is a
# correctness one in both directions:
#
#   - every breakage's gate run would be red because a LATER breakage's copy
#     carries a `.golangci.yml`, so a breakage could be "caught" by a defect it
#     did not introduce; and
#   - breakage 31b, which asserts the gate is GREEN on a copy whose config
#     MATCHES kit's, would be red because breakage 31's copy — a sibling, in the
#     same directory — has one that does not.
#
# A control that goes red for a reason another test created is worse than no
# control, because it reads as evidence. One directory per copy makes each
# breakage's fleet exactly itself: deterministic, and each result attributable
# to the breakage under test and nothing else.

# `$WORK/$name/kit`, NOT `$WORK/$name`, and the reason is a proof that passes for the
# wrong reason.
#
# Every `expect_red_check` runs `validate.sh` inside a throwaway copy, and
# `validate.sh` asks `fleet_check.py` about `$ROOT/..` — the copy's PARENT. If
# that parent is `$WORK`, then every fixture fleet an earlier breakage built
# (`$WORK/fixtures/<name>/{alpha,beta}`, each with a `.git`) is a repository the
# gate can see, and the first one's `alpha` is still broken. So breakage 52's
# defect makes EVERY LATER breakage go red, and breakages 53-55 would pass on
# `FAIL fleet` whether or not the mutation they applied was the defect they name.
#
# Four proofs asserting nothing, caused by a directory that was one level too
# high. `<name>/` is a directory that holds one copy and nothing else, so a copy's
# parent contains exactly one entry — itself — and that entry has no `.git`.
# --- SHARDING ----------------------------------------------------------------
#
# WHY. Measured, not guessed: one `--static-only` validate.sh run takes ~50s on
# this machine, and this file runs one per breakage. 76 breakages x 50s is
# roughly 63 MINUTES of wall clock for a suite whose actual work is parallelisable
# and independent. That is the single reason this file was described as taking
# "hours", and it was never the assertions -- it is 76 sequential subprocesses.
#
# WHAT THIS IS. `KIT_SELF_TEST_SHARD=i/n` runs only the breakages where
# `i % n == index`. Every other breakage's helper becomes a no-op that returns 0
# WITHOUT running the gate, and the summary says so rather than silently
# reporting a fraction of the suite as if it were all of it.
#
# WHAT THIS IS NOT. It does not weaken any assertion. A sharded run asserts
# exactly the assertions it would have run unsharded, on the same copies, with
# the same mutations; the only difference is which recipes execute. And a shard
# that goes red is a real red: the exit status is the shard's own.
#
# THE HONEST PART, which is why this is opt-in and never the default. A sharded
# run CANNOT report "all N breakages hold" -- it has not run all N. So the
# summary line says which shard it was, and the count it prints is the count it
# actually ran. A suite that quietly reported 1/8th of itself as a pass is the
# exact failure this file exists to prevent, and it applies to the harness too.

  # `.github` is in this list and not an afterthought: the reusable workflow it

  # files in it, and a copy without it would fail on a missing path rather than
  # on the defect under test — which is a self_test that proves nothing.
  # `lint` is here for the same reason `.github` is: the breakages below mutate
  # files in it and read files in it, and a copy without it would fail on a
  # missing path rather than on the defect under test — which is a self_test
  # that proves nothing.
  # `.gitleaks.toml` is here for the same reason, and its absence is the loudest
  # version of that failure this file has: kit-08's gitleaks check reads it by
  # path and REFUSES to run without it, so a copy that left it behind failed the
  # control — "the gate is RED on an unbroken tree" — for a reason that had
  # nothing to do with the tree. Three checks went red at once (the allowlist's
  # own shape, the behavioural `--redact` proof, and the scan), and every one of
  # them was reporting the missing file.
  #
  # The list below is therefore the set of things the gate READS, and it has to
  # be re-extended whenever a packet adds a check that reads a new path. That is
  # a real coupling between the harness and the tree, and it is better than the
  # alternative: a check that silently cannot run in a copy is a proof that
  # proves nothing while reporting something.
  # `LICENSE` is here for the same reason, and its absence is a false GREEN:
  # `license_check` reads the file to assert the MIT grant, so a copy without it
  # fails that check on every breakage — and the two green-expecting proofs
  # (23b, 59) would then be red for a reason that has nothing to do with the
  # defect under test, which is the failure mode this list exists to prevent.
  # `DECISIONS.md` is here for the same reason as `LICENSE`, and its absence is a
  # red on EVERY breakage rather than a false green: `decisions_check` reads it
  # by path to assert the file exists and records real entries, so a copy without
  # it fails that check sixty-odd times over — and the green-expecting proofs
  # (23b, 59) would report a red for a reason that has nothing to do with the
  # defect under test. kit-21 is what exposed this: the file did not exist at all
  # until that packet, so nothing had ever needed it here.

# expect_red_check <label> <dir> <check-label> <validate.sh args...>
#
# The stronger form of expect_red, and the one the layout/documentation checks
# need. `the gate went red` is a weak proof when forty checks can make it red:
# a breakage can be caught by the wrong check and still read as a pass, and the
# check it was written for can be dead code forever. This asserts that ONE
# named check reported FAIL, so a check that stops being load-bearing fails
# here rather than being discovered months later by the defect it missed.
#
# The check label is matched as a literal prefix of the FAIL line, so it is the
# exact label validate.sh prints. A rename on either side breaks this loudly,
# which is the intended behaviour: a renamed check and a stale proof are the
# same defect.
#
# THE MATCH IS A SUBSTRING TEST ON THE VARIABLE, NOT `printf | grep -q`, and it
# has to be. `grep -q` exits at the FIRST match and closes the pipe, so the
# writer takes SIGPIPE and dies 141 — and this script runs under `set -o
# pipefail`, which promotes that 141 to the status of the whole pipeline. The
# `if` then reads a match as a NON-match.
#
# That is not theoretical here; it is what the first run of this merge
# produced. Breakage 11 (hadolint) and breakage 42 (the working-tree
# credential) both produce a gate run larger than the 64KB pipe buffer, and both
# were reported as "the gate went red, but NOT via `<the check that fired>`" —
# while printing that very check among the FAIL lines it had just proven was
# there. Underneath the threshold it matches; at or above it, the proof of the
# best-behaved check in the file failed for a reason that had nothing to do with
# the check. Same defect `tests/canary_test.sh` already records for
# `docker logs | grep -q`, and the same rule answers it here: the output is
# ALREADY captured in a variable, so there is no reason to introduce a pipe at
# all. Matching the variable is not merely safer than the pipe — it makes the
# assertion independent of how much the gate prints, which is a property the
# piped version did not have.

    #
    # It is not hypothetical. Under load average 15 on a 16GB box, kit-19's own
    # full gate reported breakage 35 this way — `exit 1` with an empty finding
    # list — and the only honest description is that the recipe could not be
    # evaluated. Breakage 39 already exists for the same reason and asserts the
    # EXPLANATION rather than the exit status, on the principle that a red which
    # misattributes itself sends the next reader to the wrong file.
    #
    # `validate.sh` exits 1 on a FAIL, 2 on a usage error, and (line 132, 3195)
    # 1 from bootstrap when it cannot install its own dependencies — the last of
    # which prints its reason and never reaches a single check. So: a non-zero
    # exit WITH findings is a real red; a non-zero exit with NONE is an
    # environment failure, and it is named as one rather than counted as a
    # breakage the check failed to catch.
    #
    # `starts_with_line`, and NOT `printf … | grep -qE '^(FAIL|SKIP)'`. This is
    # the same broken-pipe defect the `FAIL $want` test above was fixed for —
    # fixed there and missed here, and the consequence is measured rather than
    # argued: on a 239KB gate report whose findings sit at the TOP, the piped form
    # exits **141** with the match present, so `! pipeline` is true and a gate
    # that printed `FAIL: 1 check(s) failed.` was classified as having reported no
    # finding at all.
    #
    # The mechanism is that `grep -q` closes the pipe on its first match,
    # `printf` dies of SIGPIPE, and `set -o pipefail` promotes 141 to the
    # pipeline's status. So the verdict flips on the size of the output rather
    # than on what is in it, and the threshold is a property of the pipe buffer —
    # it would move with the machine and come back as a flake on somebody else's
    # packet. It is also the *worst* direction to be wrong in: the failure mode is
    # a real red being excused as a machine problem, which is the outcome this
    # counter was added to prevent being lost. Four breakages (71, 75, 76, 77)
    # were reported as ENVIRONMENT failures on a run where every one of them had

    # a FAIL". A substring test is therefore answered YES by a passing gate, and

# expect_green_check <label> <dir> <check-label> <needle> <validate.sh args...>
#
# The mirror of `expect_red_check`, and it exists for exactly one case: a
# finding the gate is supposed to report WITHOUT failing on. "The gate stayed
# green" is necessary but far too weak — the gate is green on a tree where the
# fleet check crashed, or exited 2 and had its SKIP swallowed, or printed
# nothing at all. So this asserts BOTH halves:
#
#   1. the named check reported PASS, and
#   2. `needle` — a literal string from the finding — is in the output.
#
# (1) alone is the "silently skipped" failure this repository keeps warning
# about, and (2) alone would be satisfied by a check that printed the word
# somewhere. Together they are the claim: *this* check passed, and it passed
# while telling you about this specific thing.
#
# BOTH halves match the VARIABLE with a shell pattern, and never with
# `printf … | grep -qF`. That is the same rule `expect_red_check` already follows
# for the reason documented at length there: `grep -q` exits at the FIRST match
# and closes the pipe, `printf` takes SIGPIPE and dies 141, `set -o pipefail`
# promotes that 141 to the pipeline's status, and `!` then reads a match as a
# NON-match.
#
# It is not theoretical HERE either, and this helper had the defect that
# `expect_red_check` had already been repaired for. Breakage 59 asserted the
# adoption ceiling stayed green and named its finding, and it began failing the
# moment kit's gate output crossed the 64K pipe buffer — which is exactly what
# `license_check` printing its measurement on PASS did, correctly, as
# `check`'s own contract requires of a check that reports WHICH SPEC it verified.
# So the gate grew, the harness read the growth as a defect in the ceiling, and
# reported a proof red that had in fact passed:
#
#     FAIL self_test: breakage 59: … the gate stayed GREEN but
#       `fleet  (adopting repositories clean;` did not report PASS
#     tests/self_test.sh: line 589: printf: write error: Broken pipe
#
# The two possible fixes were to stop the check printing, or to stop the harness
# piping. Stopping the check printing was the wrong one twice over: it would
# contradict `check`'s documented behaviour, and the threshold it hides behind
# is a property of the pipe buffer, so it would move with the machine and the
# bug would come back as a flake on somebody else's packet. The output was
# already captured in a variable; there is no reason to pipe at all.

# fixture_fleet <name> — a throwaway FLEET for the four breakages below.
#
# WHY A FIXTURE AND NOT THE REAL ONE. The fleet gate is red on master, by design
# and on purpose. If these breakages ran against the real sibling checkouts, every
# one of them would be red before it started — and `expect_red_check` answers
# "did THAT NAMED check go red", so a tree that is red for an unrelated reason
# makes the proof meaningless in the one direction that matters. A fixture is
# green, so a red can only have come from the breakage.
#
# It is also what makes the proofs hermetic. They need a fleet-shaped directory
# with two repositories in it, and building two is cheaper and more predictable
# than depending on whoever is checked out next to kit on the machine.
#
# FIXTURE SHAPE, and each part is load-bearing:
#   alpha/  a service that has adopted the stack: a `kit.ref` with a real pin,
#           a compose file that is a genuine OVERRIDE (its own service, no
#           `ports:`, nothing kit ships), and no collector config of its own.
#   beta/   the same, so a breakage aimed at alpha cannot be masked by beta and a
#           check that only ever looks at the first repository is caught.
#
# `.git` is a directory, not a worktree marker file, because fleet_check.py skips
# worktrees — a fixture that looked like a worktree would be skipped and every
# breakage below would pass vacuously.
fixture_fleet() {
  # Two `local`s and not one. `local name="$1" root="…$name"` reads `name` while
  # it is still being assigned, so `root` is built from whatever `name` happened
  # to be — empty on the first call, so every fixture would be written to one
  # directory and the breakages would share it and mask each other. shellcheck
  # says so (SC2318), and the symptom is four proofs that all pass or all fail
  # together.
  local name="$1"
  # `fixtures/`, not `$WORK` directly — for the reason `fresh_copy` writes to
  # `copies/`. A fixture fleet is a fleet of REPOSITORIES, each with a `.git`;
  # anywhere a later `expect_red_check` can discover one, an earlier breakage's
  # still-broken `alpha` makes the next breakage red for the wrong reason. Only

# THE SYNTHETIC FLEET
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# `tests/gate_declaration_check.py` sweeps a directory of adopting
# repositories — `gate.yml` plus the workflow it names. There is no such
# directory inside kit, for the same reason `tests/staleness_test.sh` builds its
# own: kit is one repository and the fleet is fifteen, and a check that read the
# real working directory would be green on Tuesday and red on Wednesday for a
# reason that has nothing to do with what it checks.
#
# So a clean one is built here, once, and `KIT_FLEET` points every run of
# `validate.sh` in this script at it. Two consequences, both wanted:
#
#   * the control below becomes the fleet check's POSITIVE case. A sweep that
#     only ever runs on a red fleet has proved it can fail and nothing about
#     whether it is right;
#   * a breakage mutates its OWN copy of the fleet and nothing else, so
#     breakages cannot mask each other, exactly as `fresh_copy` guarantees for
#     the rest of this file.
#
# It is a two-file repository on purpose. Both are the real spellings: a
# one-line `run:` in the workflow, and a proof pattern with no escape token —
# which is the state every repository in this fleet is supposed to be in.

# redirect breakage 25's sweep.
#
# THE FLEET IS REBUILT BY `fresh_fleet` FOR EVERY RECIPE, AND RESTORED AFTER
# THE LAST ONE. Both halves are load-bearing, and the second half was a real
# cross-packet failure rather than a hypothetical:
#
#   * `fresh_fleet` is called again after this point, so the *clean* pair below
#     is only the starting state, not the state every later recipe sees.
#   * the last fleet recipe leaves a DELIBERATELY BROKEN repository in `$FLEET`
#     — that is the whole mechanism, a sweep that cannot go red proves nothing.
#     With `KIT_FLEET` still exported, every gate run after it inherits that
#     broken repository. The integration branch hit this exactly: breakage 31b,

#     failed with `FAIL adopting repositories (no workaround for a fixed core
#     defect)` — a red created by another test, which is the exact failure mode
#     this harness exists to prevent.
#
# So the fleet is put back the way it was found before the file does anything
# else. `unset` rather than a reset value, because the honest state of the
# environment on entry is "unset" — and a recipe that must not see a fleet then
# gets the same behaviour it would get outside this file.

# 21. THE SHARPEST ONE. Break the classifier so an UNRECOGNISED change is

#     in classify_test.sh that asserts a failure is now asserting nothing, and
#     the suite must go red rather than quietly reporting 16 passes.
#
#     This is the difference between "the classifier fails closed" as a claim in

#     here, in the gate, and it is one line long: which is the point. The
#     fail-closed property is one `if` returning `"FILE"`, and the only thing
#     standing between that `if` and a fleet-wide silent break is this test.
#
#     It edits `unrecognisedIsBreaking` in tests/rules.json rather than a string in
#     Python, and that is the entire reason the value lives there. The first
#     version of this breakage inverted a hardcoded "FILE" inside classify.py and
#     the suite stayed GREEN - because the same tier was ALSO a rule in
#     rules.json, so the headline case never reached the line that was broken.

# 24-26. THE D12/D13 WORKAROUNDS, in the three shapes they actually took.
#
# `core` shipped two checker defects that forced adopters into local
# workarounds, and both are now fixed: D12 (`RUN_KEY` could not see a one-line
# `run:`) in 63fd319, and D13 (proofs matched against bytes carrying ANSI
# colour) in c63af27. A rule about those lives in `tests/validate.sh` now rather
# than in a report, and these three are that rule's proof.
#
# All three mutate the SYNTHETIC FLEET, not a throwaway copy of the tree: the
# check reads a directory of adopting repositories and kit is not one. Each
# takes its own `fresh_fleet` so one cannot mask the next, which is the same
# discipline `fresh_copy` provides for everything else here.
#
# 24 is the shape `cafaye-rb` shipped for six weeks — a step written `run: |`
# whose entire body is the gate command, plus a comment above it saying the
# one-liner would be invisible. It is the most important of the three because it
# is the only one that is BOTH detectable structurally and invisible in
# behaviour: core reads the step either way, so nothing else in the fleet
# notices.

#

#     against the GATE, which stayed green and the breakage failed: kit's CI has
#     no sibling checkouts, so no gate in this repository can know which
#     repositories exist. A recipe that asserts a check which does not exist is
#     a proof of nothing, and the fix is to re-point it at a property the gate

# 29. A HARNESS THAT LIES ABOUT ITS OWN FLEET.
#

#     text named the reporter, which is precisely what it must not do when the
#     reporter was reading a smaller fleet rather than misreading a full one.
#
#     So the fixture is now checked before any case asserts on it: every service
#     the cases name must have a cell the reporter measured. This breakage
#     removes one service's `.git` — the shape a transient `git init` failure
#     leaves behind — and asserts the suite goes red AND says the failure is in
#     the fixture rather than in the reporter. A check that only proved the
#     script exits non-zero would pass on a suite that reported the same
#     misleading red, so the assertion is on the message.

# 30. A TOOLCHAIN FLOOR THAT IS NOT WIRED TO ANYTHING.
#
#     The ruby floor check exists because a system ruby 2.6.10 on PATH made the
#     suite report three NoMethodErrors and the summary blame the template. A
#     check like that is exactly the kind that is written, admired, and never
#     fires — the floor function can be defined, the suite can still be invoked
#     unconditionally, and the gate is green on a machine that cannot run the
#     template at all.
#
#     So the breakage deletes the ONE line that consults the floor, leaving the
#     probe defined and never called, and asserts the ruby check still reports
#     the suite. Written as the well-intentioned edit a contributor makes when
#     the guard "looks redundant" next to a `have ruby` test three lines above:
#     the tool is present, so why ask whether it is the right one? The assertion
#     is on the check's own label, so a red from any other check does not pass
#     for this one.
#
#     Only meaningful where ruby is installed, and a missing interpreter is
#     reported as a SKIP rather than quietly passing — self_test's own rule is
#     that a skipped proof is a failed proof, so the count below stays honest.
#
#     The recipe call is kept at COLUMN 0 even though it is guarded, because the
#     count is taken with `grep -cE '^expect_red...'`: an indented call runs and
#     passes while the summary counts one fewer than it ran, and a count that
#     under-reports is the exact defect this repo treats as a lie told by a
#     measurement. The guard, not the indentation, is what makes the skip
#     explicit.
#
#     The breakage needs BOTH halves, and the second is the interesting one.
#     Deleting the guard on a machine with a current ruby proves nothing, because
#     the suite passes either way and green is the correct answer. So the copy
#     also gets a `ruby` shim that makes the interpreter old the way 2.6.10 was
#     old: `undef_method`, which raises NoMethodError at the call site exactly
#     as a missing method does. That is a simulation of the interpreter rather
#     than a dependency on one being installed — a self_test that needs a
#     particular ruby present is a self_test that SKIPs on CI and proves
#     nothing there, which is the rule this repo keeps restating.
#
#     With the shim and the guard in place the gate says the toolchain is too
#     old. With the shim and the guard DELETED it says the template is broken.
#     The recipe asserts the second, so the first cannot quietly stop happening:
#     a check that has stopped firing looks identical to a check that never did.

# the value's name. The directory variable was then reassigned to the value a few
# lines later, so `edit` was handed
# `cafaye_canary_…/templates/secrets/go/canary.go` and died with a
# FileNotFoundError — which killed breakage 50 AND 51, and the run, before the
# summary printed. Two proofs dead, reported as a crash rather than as a missing
# check. A directory variable and a value variable must never share a name here;
# `validate.sh` now checks that, because a name collision is invisible to review

#
#   61. `LICENSE` DELETED. The direction everybody can see, and the one this
#       check exists for: cafaye's decision is MIT across the fleet, and a
#       repository with no grant is not permissive — it is all rights reserved,
#       which is the default copyright position when nothing is granted. The
#       README kept saying MIT the whole time, which is exactly why it needed a
#       check: the documentation was true and the repository was not.
#   62. a root `package.json` declaring `AGPL-3.0-only`. The direction nobody
#       looks at, and the reason the check inspects manifests rather than merely
#       the file's existence. The grant is still MIT in `LICENSE` and still MIT
#       in the README; the repository has acquired a THIRD statement, a
#       compliance tool reads it, and a reader has no way to tell which one is
#       authoritative.
#
# 62 is the one that decides whether this is a real check. A check that only
# asserts `LICENSE` exists is satisfied by a repository that has drifted into
# saying two different things, which is the more likely failure — a manifest is
# easy to add and nobody thinks of it as a licence decision.

# 59-31. THE ADOPTION CEILING, both sides of it, and the pair is the proof.
#
# The fleet gate was red on master for six repositories that have adopted
# nothing, which is the same shape as a build that has been red for a quarter:
# the red is true, and it has stopped being information. The ceiling is the
# response core-16 applied to a missing OpenAPI document — absence is a named
# warning with the adoption path attached, and it becomes a failure the moment
# the repository adopts.
#
# A ceiling needs BOTH halves proved, and that is why these are two recipes over
# ONE mutation rather than one recipe over two mutations:
#
#   59  the stale copy, with no kit.ref anywhere in the fleet. The gate stays
#       GREEN, and the finding is PRINTED, with the adoption path. If this one
#       goes red the ceiling does not exist — the gate is failing unadopted
#       repositories, which is the state the packet was dispatched to fix.
#   60  the identical stale copy, with kit.ref committed. The gate goes RED on
#       the identical finding. If this one stays green then the ceiling is not
#       a ceiling but a deletion: the checks no longer decide anything at all.
#
# 60 is breakage 52 plus one committed line, and that is the entire argument in
# one diff. Nothing about the predicate, the message or the severity changed
# between them; what changed is whether the repository has accepted the standard
# it is being measured against.
#
# The needle in 59 is a literal substring of the finding rather than the word
# `WARN`. A check that printed "WARN" and nothing else would satisfy the weaker
# assertion, and a check that deleted the finding entirely and left the string
# in a comment would satisfy it too — which is the shape this repository has
# already been bitten by once, with a policy stated in both the Python and a

#     measurements.
#
#     The mutation is the shape `identity` carries today, copied out of its
#     docker-compose.yml rather than invented: a `postgres:` service with no
#     `image:` — kit ships the container — and the three keys overridden on it.
#
#     The absence of `image:` is load-bearing rather than incidental, and it is
#     the guard that keeps this a proof of the RIGHT check. With an `image:`

#     defect, two findings, and this breakage would go red for a reason that has

# 78-82. THE KAMAL CONFIG, and the green control 78b.
#
# RENUMBERED. This block was 78-82 and its 78b/78/79 collided with the 78/79 of
# the licence block above, which the kit-22 union merge put in the same file
# without either side noticing. Two recipes sharing a label is not cosmetic: the
# suite's own summary counts breakage NUMBERS, so a collision made it report 82
# while 84 recipes existed, and made "breakage 78" ambiguous to anyone reading
# a failure. Found by sharding the suite and checking that the shards covered
# every number exactly once -- 78 and 79 came up claimed twice.
#
# The numbers moved to 78-82 so this block ends the file, next to nothing. If
# more breakages are added, continue from 83.
#
# Every recipe below mutates `templates/kamal/` and asserts a NAMED check goes
# red, because "the gate went red" is a weak claim when forty other checks could
# have gone red instead.
#
# The green control is not optional here in the way it is elsewhere. Breakages
# 78, 79 and 82 all work by making `tests/kamal_test.sh` fail; if the UNMODIFIED
# tree's generated config did not satisfy the real binaries, every one of those
# three would pass for the wrong reason — the check would be reporting "this
# template is broken" when what it reports is "every template is broken". So 78b
# runs the same script on the same binaries and asserts it is green, and it runs
# FIRST, so a red in 78-82 reads as what it is rather than as an environment
# problem.

# 88: the SECOND tenant.
#
# Every other recipe in this file proves that ONE service gets a database. This
# one is the first to ask what happens when a second name is appended, and it
# exists because that question had never been asked and the answer was wrong.
#
# The defect was measured on a live cluster, not inferred:
#
#   $ KIT_POSTGRES_DATABASES="billing neighbour" bin/dev up
#   postgres-1 | [cluster] provisioning billingneighbour
#   postgres-1 | [cluster] done: 1 service database(s), one role each, PUBLIC holds CONNECT on none of them
#
# One database, named after BOTH services fused together, and a stack reporting
# success. `require_identifier` — whose own comment names "builds one identifier
# out of two tokens" as the failure worth preventing — could not see it, because
# the `tr -d '[:space:]'` in front of it DELETED the space first and handed the
# validator a perfectly legal identifier. Every check that could have caught
# this was looking at a single name.
#
# That is the shape of the blind spot, and it is worth stating plainly: this
# suite proved the one-cluster promise for the first tenant and was silent about
# the second. A fleet of nine services is nine repetitions of a case nobody had
# run twice.
#
# The proof runs the real `10-cluster.sh` with the real `psql` stubbed by a
# recording function, so it asserts the actual parse — which names it
# provisions and whether it refuses — without needing a container or a volume.

#
# THE MUTATION IS LINE 144, NOT THE `service=` ASSIGNMENT, and getting that wrong
# is what made this proof vacuous for one merge cycle — it stayed GREEN on a tree
# carrying the exact defect it exists to catch.
#
# The fix for the fused name is not "stop using `tr -d`". It is TWO things: the
# outer trim at 144 keeps only the edges, and the `case` at 147 REFUSES a name
# that still holds whitespace inside it. The `service="$trimmed"` assignment at
# 156 is downstream of that refusal and is never reached for a fused name — the
# script has already exited 1 at 152. So mutating 156 puts the old `tr -d` back
# in a line that never runs, the refusal still fires, the test stays green, and
# the proof reports success while reintroducing nothing at all.
#
# Mutating 144 is the defect itself: `trimmed` becomes "billingneighbour", the
# `case` sees no whitespace, nothing is refused, and one database named after
# both services is provisioned by a stack that reports itself healthy. Measured
# both ways; the 144 mutation is the one that goes red.

# 75: THE ONE THAT WOULD HAVE CAUGHT A REGRESSION KIT-21 SHIPPED.
#
# kit-21 turned the cluster into a BUILT image, so kit's compose went from
#
#     image: postgres:${KIT_POSTGRES_TAG:-…}      ->  image: kit-postgres:${…}
#
# and `check_stale_copy` — FAILURE MODE 1, the check whose whole job is naming
# the services running their own copy of the platform — matched a service's image
# against kit's by BARE REPOSITORY NAME. The rename changed `postgres` to
# `kit-postgres`, a duplicating service still writes `postgres`, and the two
# stopped matching. Measured, on the commit that shipped it:
#
#     $ fleet_check.py --repos-dir <fleet whose alpha runs postgres:17>
#     PASS fleet: no service carries a copy of kit's stack, …
#
# Five repositories in the real fleet carry their own postgres, so the check
# written to name them was reporting a clean fleet, and it did so SILENTLY: it
# still ran, still printed PASS, and printed no skip.
#
# WHY 52/59/60 DID NOT CATCH IT, which is the part worth a breakage of its own.
#
# `break_stale_copy` writes a `ports:` entry on the copy, and
# `check_override_surface` reports a published port by SERVICE NAME — a name the
# rename never touched. So breakage 60 went red on the port half and nobody found
# out the image half had stopped working. The recipe was green; the check it was
# proving was half dead.
#
# That is a green control proving less than it appears to, and this repository's
# own rule about controls says so directly: a control that goes red for a reason
# another check created is not evidence. So 75 is the SAME defect with the
# `ports:` line REMOVED, which leaves `check_override_surface` nothing to report
# and makes the image comparison the only thing that can go red. If the image
# half is ever disarmed again, 60 stays green and 75 does not.
#
# The needle is the finding's own text rather than the check's PASS line, so a
# `check_stale_copy` that stopped firing and a fleet check that passed for some
# other reason cannot be confused for one another.

# 76-77: THE DOCUMENTED `bin/dev` COMMANDS ARE REAL.
#
# kit-21 added `bin/dev db grant` to four files' prose — templates/database/
# README.md, DECISIONS.md, the init script and the compose file — and never added
# the command. Every one of those four is a reader told the way out of "my
# service's database was never created" exists, running it, and getting
# `unknown command`. DECISIONS.md exists because this repository referenced a
# document that did not exist; this is the same defect one layer down, and it is
# the reason there is now a check for it.
#
# TWO recipes rather than one, because there are two ways to break it and they
# fail differently. Removing the whole `db` arm leaves a documented COMMAND with
# nothing behind it. Removing only the `grant` arm leaves a command whose
# SUBCOMMAND is gone — and that is the harder one, because a check which only
# asks "is `db` dispatched" reports a clean tree while four files still promise
# `db grant`. Both were measured by hand before they were written down here.
#
# The needle is the finding's own wording, so a `bin_dev_command_check` that had
# silently stopped firing cannot be confused with a different check going red.

# 78-79: kit OWNS A SECOND CALLABLE STANDARD, AND THE WIDENED COPY CHECK IS
#         STILL A COPY CHECK.
#
# kit-32 added `.github/workflows/image.reusable.yml` — the workflow that builds
# a service's image and pushes it to ghcr.io — because nothing in the fleet
# built the image `config/deploy.yml` deploys. Adding it made `callable_check`
# go RED, naming a second copy of the CI standard where there was a second
# STANDARD. The check's rule was "exactly one file may declare
# `workflow_call`", which is a freeze dressed as a drift check, and kit-32
# widened it: files at paths in REUSABLE_WORKFLOWS are exempt, and everything
# else is judged on its parsed `name:`.
#
# A widened check is a check that might have been widened into uselessness, and
# the only way to know is to break it in both directions it now claims to cover.
# Two breakages rather than one, for that reason, and they must be caught by
# DIFFERENT findings in the same check: 78 is the original defect (a parked
# copy), 79 is the new one the widening made possible (a callable workflow
# nobody declared).
#
# Without them the honest description of the widening would be "a check that had
# been reporting a defect that did not exist now reports nothing at all", which
# is a plausible sentence and, as far as anyone would know, an accurate one.

# The count is COUNTED, not written down. Every breakage above calls exactly one
# of the four red-expecting helpers, so this cannot drift from the recipes the
# way a hardcoded "all N breakages" does — and the header's list is checked
# against it by `tests/validate.sh`, so a breakage added without a header entry
# (or a header entry with no recipe) is a red gate rather than a doc that lies.
#   Anchored on the breakage LABEL, and identical to the `_st_breakages` /
#   `_st_reds` patterns in tests/validate.sh. Both used to anchor on `^expect_`,
#   which also matched the four helper *definitions* — `expect_red() {` looks
#   exactly like a call to a name-only pattern — so this printed 28 over 23
#   recipes for a run. Two files printing two different counts of the same file,
#   side by side, is the defect this repo keeps refusing to ship; the fix is to
#   count something that cannot be a definition.
#
#   Only the reds are counted as reds, and the green-expecting proofs are named
#   separately. Breakages 23b and 59 assert a green gate on purpose — 23b names a
#   SKIP, 59 names a FINDING — and a summary claiming either "went red" would be
#   a false statement about a proof that passed. kit-12's 31b is an `expect_green`
#   and is deliberately not in either count: it is a control, and its label
#   carries a number so the header can name the claim without giving a control a
#   numbered entry. `tests/validate.sh` says the same thing in the same words.
#
#   `env_skips` cannot appear in this sentence at all, and that is deliberate: it
#   is non-zero only on a run that exits 1 above, so the PASS line is only ever
#   printed when every recipe was EVALUATED. A count of proofs that ran is not a
#   claim that they held, which is why the sentence says "hold" and why the
