# kit — the provenance stamp's own proof. Three things, in the order they fail.
#
#   A. THE GRAMMAR. Every shape that could leak into a registry-stamped label is
#      REFUSED, by shape, and the refusal names the field and the rule. This is
#      the redaction half of P3-18 and it is the part people skip.
#   B. THE THREE AGREE. The field list, the OCI label keys and the JSON the file
#      sink writes are ONE fact stated in three places. This reads all three and
#      fails when they disagree -- and it needs no docker, because it is a
#      comparison of what the scripts EMIT, not of an image.
#   C. THE BUILD. A real image, built from a real Dockerfile, with both sinks
#      compared and the consumer check required to go red on a wrong commit.
#      SKIPs loudly without docker, per the rule that a check which ran nothing
#      is not a pass.
#
# WHY NO DOCKER IN (A) AND (B). They are the security claims, and a security
# claim that is only executed where docker happens to be installed is a claim
# whose coverage depends on the machine. Both are pure text in, pure exit status
# out.

# `org.opencontainers.image.source` as our provenance and exited 0, and the
# suite above could not see it, because every `--verify` case in part C is a
# case about an image kit's own Dockerfile built -- and a foreign base image's
# labels are precisely the labels kit's Dockerfile did NOT write.
#
# So the LABEL SINK IS STUBBED. A `docker` on PATH that answers
# `image inspect` with a canned JSON and nothing else, which makes the whole
# consumer side -- shape, ownership, absent-field policy, exit-code separation --
# executable as pure text in and exit status out, with no daemon and no build.
# That is the same rule part A and part B are under, applied to the half that
# had no coverage at all: a security claim whose coverage depends on whether
# docker happens to be installed is a claim about the machine.
#
# It is ALSO the control for part C. Part C proves the checks fire on a real
# image; this proves they fire on labels kit would never have written, which is
# the case part C structurally cannot produce.
