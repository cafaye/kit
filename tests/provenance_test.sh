# kit — the provenance stamp's own proof. Three things, in the order they fail.
#
#   A. THE GRAMMAR. Every shape that could leak into a registry-stamped label is
#      REFUSED, by shape, and the refusal names the field and the rule. This is
#      the redaction half of P3-18 and it is the part people skip.
#   B. THE THREE AGREE. The field list, the OCI label keys and the JSON the file
#      sink writes are ONE fact stated in three places. This reads all three and
#      fails when they disagree -- and it needs no docker, because it is a
#      comparison of what the scripts EMIT, not of an image.
#   C. THE BUILD. A real image, built from a real Dockerfile, with both sinks
#      compared and the consumer check required to go red on a wrong commit.
#      SKIPs loudly without docker, per the rule that a check which ran nothing
#      is not a pass.
#
# WHY NO DOCKER IN (A) AND (B). They are the security claims, and a security
# claim that is only executed where docker happens to be installed is a claim
# whose coverage depends on the machine. Both are pure text in, pure exit status
# out.

# The OCI label keys, written out here rather than read out of a Dockerfile, so
# that a Dockerfile which lost one of them is a finding and not a new normal.

# --write's JSON keys, read out of a real write rather than out of the source.
