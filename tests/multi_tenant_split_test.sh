# How `KIT_POSTGRES_DATABASES` is split into tenants.
#
# ONE shared Postgres cluster with a database and a role PER SERVICE is the whole
# point of this fleet's database topology, and this file is the only check in kit
# that asks what that means for the SECOND name in the list. Every other check —
# including the harness rule that insists a harness declares its tenant, and the
# live stack test that asserts a tenant was really provisioned — exercises the
# single-tenant case, which is the case that had always worked.
#
# The defect this exists for was measured, live, on billing's stack:
#
#   $ KIT_POSTGRES_DATABASES="billing neighbour" bin/dev up
#   postgres-1 | [cluster] provisioning billingneighbour
#   postgres-1 | [cluster] done: 1 service database(s), one role each, PUBLIC holds CONNECT on none of them
#
# One database named after both services, and a green stack. The parse stripped
# whitespace before validating, so the two names arrived at `require_identifier`
# already fused into one legal identifier — and a legal identifier is precisely
# what the validator is built to accept.
#
# WHAT MAKES THIS A TEST AND NOT A COMMENT
# ---------------------------------------
# It runs the real `templates/compose/postgres/initdb/10-cluster.sh` and reads the
# real parse out of it. It does not re-implement the split in a way that could
# agree with a broken script, and it does not need a container: `psql` is a
# recording stub, so this costs milliseconds where the live measurement took a
# full `bin/dev up`. The thing under test is the parsing in the init script, so
# the init script is what runs — the stub replaces the DATABASE, not the LOGIC.
#
# The cases are chosen so that a fix which simply stopped trimming whitespace
# would fail here: "billing, neighbour" must still provision two tenants, because
# a space after a comma is how people actually write these lists and refusing it
# would be a regression in the other direction.

# the validation, and the refusal. What comes back is one line per provisioned
# service, plus whatever the script itself printed, so a refusal is observable.
#
# `POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD` and friends are set because the script refuses an
# unset `KIT_POSTGRES_DATABASES` before it reaches anything else; passing them
