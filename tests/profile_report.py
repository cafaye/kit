"""Render the TSV `tests/validate.sh` writes when `KIT_PROFILE` is set.

WHY THIS IS A PROGRAM AND NOT A `sort`. The file it reads is appended to by
every gate copy the self-test spawns, so it has ~1,000 rows whose labels are
long, whose kinds are four (`check`, `cpu`, `tier`, `phase`), and which fall
into two populations that must never be added together: the GATE's rows and the
SELF-TEST's rows. Aggregating those into one column is how a profile claims a
ten-minute run that cost four, and it is why this renders the two populations
separately and refuses to sum a `cpu` row with a `phase` row.

Standard library only, like the other two programs in `tests/`. `validate.sh`'s
`carve-out boundary` check walks the AST of every Python file in this directory
and fails on an import outside json/os/re/sys/argparse/subprocess/difflib/glob/
urllib/__future__ — so this imports three of those and is green on arrival. It
is a FOURTH program under that rule's carve-out and it is deliberately the
smallest: it reads a file and prints a table.
