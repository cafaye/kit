# --no-live, and why it exists and why it is not --no-observability:
#   `--no-observability` drops the whole phase, INCLUDING the two database
#   boundary tiers. `--no-live` drops the three docker stacks the observability
#   PLATFORM is proven by, and leaves the cluster tiers alone. The distinction
#   matters because the two sets of claims are not the same: one is "the
#   collector works", the other is "a service cannot read another service's
#   rows". A child gate that asserts a file-level defect needs neither, and
#   `tests/self_test.sh` is 104 whole gates — each of which used to bring up
#   three docker stacks to learn one fact about one named check, on a machine
#   that may also be running five other workers' gates. That is contention, and
#   contention is what turned breakage 23b — a green-expecting proof about the
#   ruby interpreter floor — red at recipe 23 of 104 in a full suite run while
#   it was green standalone. (REPORTED, not reproduced: 23b's gate run is green
#   on this machine, standalone and in a full suite run. The claim is the
#   EXPOSURE — one whole gate, half of it docker, asserting nothing about any of
#   it — and REPORT-kit-selftest-live-tier-01.md §2 keeps the two apart.)
#   The opt-out is the fix and the bound is not: a bound widened to accommodate
#   the machine it runs on has stopped measuring the thing it was written for.
#
#   WHAT IT IS NOT: silence. Each of the three tiers becomes a `SKIP` naming the
#   flag, counted in the skip tally and printed in the summary, because a skip
#   that cannot be seen is a silent pass. Nothing sets this flag on a gate a
#   human or CI runs; see `live_check` for the shape and `AGENTS.md`.
#
# Six phases, all of which must pass:
#   static         every artifact parses, and the strictness decisions are still
#                  what we wrote them down to be (env-substituted endpoints, every
#                  compose port parameterized, every placeholder documented, and
#                  the collector's redaction allowlist DERIVED FROM core's
#                  schemas rather than transcribed beside them).
#   telemetry      the W3C traceparent templates are EXECUTED, one suite per
#                  language. This is the phase that is easy to fake and so is
#                  the one that runs the code rather than greps it.
#   observability  the two claims that are worth nothing unexercised: that a
#                  canary secret in a prompt-shaped attribute reaches no
#                  exporter, and that a service starts and serves with the
#                  collector killed. Both need a real collector, so both SKIP
#                  loudly without docker — never pass silently.
#   self_test      breaks a throwaway copy of this tree once per kind of check
#                  and asserts the gate goes red each time. A gate that cannot
#                  fail is not a gate.
#   lint           golangci-lint, RuboCop, ESLint and yamllint are RUN against
#                  a fixture built to violate them, with kit's config, and each
#                  is paired with a control that must answer differently. This
#                  is the phase `lint/` never had: 249 lines of configuration
#                  that parsed cleanly and had never been pointed at anything.
#
# One line per check: PASS, FAIL, or SKIP. Any FAIL exits 1. A SKIP is always
# reported in the summary — never hidden.
#
# Dependencies: PyYAML and yamllint (tests/requirements.txt) and hadolint, all
# three REQUIRED and all three bootstrapped by tests/bootstrap.sh on first run,
# so this one command is the whole procedure on a clean clone.
#
# node, the shellcheck binary, and the six language toolchains run when present
# and skip when they are not; the artifact-presence and static checks always
# run, so a deleted template is a failure on a machine with no toolchains at all.

# tree, and the difference matters: "exactly one workflow may be callable" is a
# rule about kit, not about drift, and following it would mean kit can never
# grow. So the walk below now distinguishes the two cases. A second file that

# checks to learn 76 facts, each of which is about ONE named check.
#
# Every breakage already names the check it is testing; it is the third argument
# to `expect_red_check`, and the assertion is that THAT check goes red. Running
# the other 213 cannot change that verdict. This is the difference between
# scheduling 76 sequential runs in parallel and not doing 16,000 units of work.
#
# WHAT IT IS NOT. It does not weaken the assertion. `expect_red_check` still
# demands `FAIL <the named check>` appear in the output and still fails if it
# does not. Narrowing WHICH checks run is not the same as loosening WHAT they
# must prove, and the difference is why this is a filter on the runner rather
# than an edit to any assertion.
#
# THE HONEST CAVEAT. A filtered run has not run the whole gate, so it must not
# be reported as if it had. `--only` therefore prints a banner naming the filter
# on every run, and the exit status is the FILTERED suite's -- never a claim
# about the checks that were excluded.

# WHY IT IS HERE AND WHY IT IS OFF BY DEFAULT. A gate that takes ten minutes
# cannot be improved from intuition: every claim about which part is slow is a
# claim about a measurement nobody can take again on the same tree. So the
# measurement is part of the gate rather than a thing the packet's worker had to
# hand-assemble with `date` calls and a scratch file.
#
# OFF BY DEFAULT, and off means off: every measurement site is one line of the
# form `_t0=0; [ -n "$_PROFILE" ] && _t0="$(_pf_now)"`, so with `KIT_PROFILE`
# unset the sites cost one `[` and one assignment and NO process — the clock is
# never read. That is a real cost to design for and not a hypothetical one: a
# profiler that made the run it profiles materially slower is a profiler whose
# numbers are wrong in the direction that matters.
#
# WHAT IT RECORDS, and what it deliberately does not. One TSV row per timed
# region: kind, label, seconds, and an inherited tag. The tag is how a row from
# inside a self-test breakage is told apart from a row from the gate itself —
# `KIT_PROFILE_TAG` is exported by `tests/self_test.sh` per breakage, so the
# profile attributes time to a BREAKAGE and not merely to a check name that 94
# copies all share. Rows are appended with `>>`, which is atomic for lines this
# short, and every writer in the tree is short enough to stay under one `PIPE_BUF`.
#
# FOUR KINDS, and why there are four rather than one.
#   check   a serial `check`/`check_verbose` — wall time of ONE command.
#   cpu     a `check_par` child — time of one parallel check. THESE OVERLAP: their
#           sum is an upper bound on the parallel region, not its elapsed time.
#           Collapsing them with the serial rows would double-count and produce a
#           profile that adds up to more than the run, which is the one thing a
#           profile must never do.
#   tier    a `bounded_check` — a whole heavy script, self_test included.
#   phase   the interval between two `section` headers. THE SAFETY NET: a tier
#           that is a bare `report` over a heredoc spawns no command at all, so
#           the check rows cannot see it, and the phase row can.
#   verdict a `report_par` — a loop reaching its verdict from a `[ -x ]`. ~0s by
#           construction; recorded so the table accounts for every printed line.
#
# NOT A GATE. Nothing here can change a verdict, and a profiling run is not a
# substitute for a plain one: `tests/profile_report.py` reads the TSV this writes
# and prints the table, and the run that printed the table is still the run whose
# exit status counts. The profile is an annotation of a run, not a check of its
# own — a file that could fail a build for being slow would be a speed gate, and
# this is not one.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# parallel checks — bounded, ordered, and provably the same verdict
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# WHY. Profiled, not guessed. Timing every `check` call individually (each one
# wrapped with a `date` before and after) put the whole `--static-only` run at
# ~35s of which the three per-file loops were 9.6s and NOTHING else was close:
#
#     25 files, one shellcheck spawn each    4.8s
#     23 files, one yamllint spawn each      2.5s
#     42 files, one parser spawn each        2.3s
#
# Every one of those is a spawn whose cost is interpreter start-up, not work:
# 25 shellcheck invocations cost 4.8s and the tree it reads is 1.2MB. The loop
# is serial because `check` is, and `check` is serial because it prints as it
# goes.
#
# WHY BOUNDED, AND WHY THIS NUMBER. Not `&` per iteration. kit's own history is
# the argument: an unbounded fan-out here previously produced load-induced
# failures — self-test shard 57 and the PG-container isolation check both went
# red under 4-way parallel load and passed serially — and a gate that fails on a
# busy machine is a gate people learn to re-run until it agrees with them. So
# concurrency is capped, and the cap is a variable rather than a constant so a
# loaded box can be dialled DOWN instead of being told it was wrong.
#
#   KIT_PARALLEL_CHECKS=<n>   1 = strictly serial (the pre-change behaviour)
#                             0 = auto: nproc, capped at 4
#
# The cap is 4 and not nproc on purpose. These are short CPU-bound spawns, so
# the win flattens well before the core count, while the RISK does not: every
# extra concurrent process is load the rest of the suite — and every other kit
# worker sharing this box — has to live with. A check that got faster by making
# the machine worse is not a speedup.
#
# WHY IT IS STILL THE SAME SUITE. Three properties, all deliberate:
#
#   1. ORDER OF REPORTING IS UNCHANGED. Results are written to one file per
#      check and replayed in submission order, so a reader sees byte-identical
#      output to the serial run. That matters because self_test.sh greps gate
#      OUTPUT for `FAIL <the named check>`, and a report that reordered itself
#      would be a report whose diffs lie.
#   2. THE EXIT STATUS OF EACH CHECK IS CAPTURED, NOT INHERITED. A background
#      job's status is read from the same file its output went to, so a red
#      check is still red and `fails` still counts it. The alternative — letting
#      `wait` decide — would make every check pass.
#   3. `--only` IS APPLIED BEFORE THE SPAWN, not after. A filtered run must not
#      pay for work it is about to discard, which is the same reason the loops
#      are skipped wholesale in a filtered run.
#
# WHAT IT IS NOT. It does not make any check weaker, skip any file, or change
# any verdict. It runs the same commands with the same arguments and reports the
# same statuses in the same order; `KIT_PARALLEL_CHECKS=1` is the old code path.

  # `set +e` FIRST, and it is load-bearing rather than defensive. This file runs

# the start of a line render as text, so nothing downstream objects.

# leaves a real hole in the one file most likely to hold the residue, and

# the fingerprint cache — P0-3 and P0-4, wired to one real tier
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# WHAT THIS IS. `tests/fingerprint.py` can build a manifest, store a record and
# decide a hit. On its own it is a library: it changes nothing about how long
# the gate takes. These two functions are the wiring, and they are the only
# place in the tree where a recorded verdict is allowed to stand in for a run.
#
# WHY IT IS OFF BY DEFAULT. Not for caution — for measurement. Every claim this
# mechanism makes is a claim about WALL CLOCK, and a cache that cannot be
# switched off cannot be measured, because the second run is the only evidence
# and it is indistinguishable from the first if the first was already warm. So
# the cache is `on` by default and off with `KIT_FINGERPRINT=0`, and the report
# quotes both numbers because the honest before-number is the one with it off.
#
# WHERE THE RECORD LIVES, and why it is overridable. `$KIT_CACHE_DIR` if set,
# else `.kit/cache/gate` under the tree. The override exists for `self_test`,
# which runs 94 whole COPIES of this tree: a cache scoped to a copy is deleted
# with the copy and can never be hit by the copy after it, so the 94 breakages
# would each pay full price for the ~113 checks they share with each other.
# One shared cache directory is what lets copy 57 skip the checks copy 23
# already ran — which is P0-1 ("run every gate exactly once") arriving as a side
# effect of P0-4 rather than as a second mechanism.
#
# WHAT IS CACHEABLE IS DECIDED BY THE DECLARATION, not by a heuristic. A
# declaration that cannot be built is not a silent miss: the tier runs, and the
# reason is printed, because a cache that quietly stops caching is a cache whose
# miss rate nobody is watching.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# `check` with a CEILING on how long it may take, and — this is the part that
# matters — a fourth, named outcome when the ceiling is reached.
#
# WHY IT EXISTS. The gate grew past what one process can finish on a loaded
# box: three docker stacks brought up and torn down, and thirty-two throwaway
# copies of a 193 KB script each running their own bootstrap. The previous full
# run on this branch was SIGKILLed (exit 137 — the kernel's OOM killer, not a
# test failure) partway through the observability collector tier, which means
# the gate reported *nothing* about the tiers it had not reached. A gate that is
# killed is a gate whose green is a claim about however far it got.
#
# `timeout N` alone would fix the symptom and hide the disease in a new place:
# a timed-out `check` prints FAIL with a two-word diagnostic that names neither
# the tier nor the bound, and the next reader files it under "flaky". So the
# bound is a verdict of its own — `BOUND` — carrying the tier, the bound and the
# tail of what it had printed. It is counted separately in the summary, because
# a bound that is reported as a PASS is exactly the silent skip the gate's own
# rules forbid, and one reported as a FAIL is indistinguishable from a defect
# in the tree.
#
# WHY IT IS NOT A SKIP. Nothing about a timed-out tier is unknown: we know it
# did not finish, and the claim it exists to prove is therefore unexercised. A
# SKIP is for a check that CANNOT run (no docker, no toolchain) and says so
# about the environment. A bound is this machine being too busy, which is a
# fact about the run and not about the tree — and it is the reason the gate
# carries a bound at all rather than being allowed to be killed.
#
# `timeout` IS NOT PORTABLE and pretending otherwise would be the same class of
# defect as the port rules this packet writes about: GNU coreutils ships it as
# `timeout`, macOS has no `/usr/bin/timeout` at all, and Homebrew's coreutils
# installs `gtimeout`. So it is RESOLVED, and a machine with neither runs the
# tier unbounded and says so in the summary — a bound that silently did not
# apply is worse than no bound, because the reader is told a ceiling exists.

# live_check <label> <bound> <command...> — the observability LIVE tier, behind
# ONE opt-out.
#
# WHAT IT IS. The three docker stacks that prove the observability platform is
# usable at all: a canary secret in ten attributes reaching no exporter, a
# service still serving with the collector killed, and the FETCHED stack coming
# up with a trace landing in Tempo and a metric in Mimir. Those are the three
# `live_check` calls in phase 30, and this wrapper is the only thing that
# decides whether they run.
#
# WHY IT IS NOT A `--only` FILTER AND NOT A WIDER BOUND. `--only` is a filter on
# a LABEL, and a breakage that wants "the gate went red" cannot use one: the
# verdict it asserts is about a check it names, and a filter broad enough to
# reach the live tier would also reach everything else. A wider bound is the
# response this repository refuses, for a reason stated in its own words further
# down: "a bound set at the observed quiet duration is a bound that fires on any
# contention at all, and a bound that fires is a tier that proved nothing" —
# and a bound widened until it stops firing on a loaded machine is a number that
# has stopped measuring the thing it was written to measure.
#
# WHY IT IS NOT `--no-observability`. That flag drops the whole phase, including
# the two cluster tiers, which are a different claim (a service cannot read
# another service's rows) at a different cost (23.9s between them, measured,
# against 128.8s for these three). A caller that wants the boundary proofs and
# not the collector proofs — or the reverse — needs both halves to be separable.
#
# WHAT THE SKIP IS, and why it is not silence. A SKIP, printed, counted in the
# tally and repeated in the summary: the rule this file keeps restating is that
# a skip nobody can see is a silent pass, and a patch that deleted the three
# `bounded_check` calls outright would satisfy every exit-status assertion while
# proving nothing. So the skip line is the whole contract.
#
# NOT FATAL, and that is a decision rather than an omission. The lint phase is
# fatal on a skip, because "kit's configs work" is unproved by a run in which no
# linter executed. `--no-live` cannot be fatal for the same reason, and the
# reason is 23b: that recipe asserts the gate is GREEN while naming a skip, so a
# fatal `--no-live` skip would red the one proof this exists to keep green. The
# honesty is carried by the count and the summary line instead — which is enough
# here because the flag is set by exactly one caller, in `tests/self_test.sh`,
# and a top-level gate never sets it.

  # `templates/kamal/*.yml.erb` is in this list, and its ABSENCE from the plain
  # `*.yml` arm is the interesting part. These templates are not YAML: they are
  # ERB that produces YAML, so `yaml.safe_load` on the file itself would be
  # checking the wrong thing — a template's own validity is a property of the
  # text after rendering.
  #
  # So the two `.erb` files are rendered with the operator's non-secret
  # variables and the RESULT is parsed, by a case below. `drill.sh` is named
  # rather than globbed as `templates/kamal/*`, because the `*)` arm reports an
  # unrecognised type as a SKIP and `README.md` would put a permanent
  # "no parser for this file type" line in every run — and a permanently
  # reported skip is a gap nobody fixes, which is the whole point of the skip
  # existing. Naming them explicitly also means a NEW file dropped into
  # `templates/kamal/` is unparsed rather than mis-parsed: the safe direction.
  # `--only` skips this whole loop. The loop shells out PER FILE -- one `bash -n`,
  # one `python -c "yaml.safe_load"`, one `json.loads` each -- and it does that
  # before any `check` has been consulted, so a filtered run was paying for ~150
  # process spawns to produce results nobody asked for. Measured: a `--only`
  # matching ONE check still took 23s, and a `--only` matching NONE took 24s,
  # which is the signature of a fixed cost that filtering could not touch.
  #
  # It is safe to skip, and the reason is structural rather than hopeful: every
  # line in the loop calls `check`, so a filtered run would skip them anyway --
  # one `check` call each, just after paying for the file walk.
  #
  # `check_par`, not `check`: 42 files and one spawn each, 2.3s measured, and
  # nearly all of it interpreter start-up. Each iteration reads one file and
  # shares nothing with the next, which is what makes them safe to overlap. The
  # arms that reach a verdict WITHOUT spawning go through `report_par` so the
  # section still prints one line per file in file order.

  #
  # A presence check would be satisfied by a `docker/entrypoint.sh` that nothing
  # runs — and, worse, would be satisfied SILENTLY by its absence: the
  # executable-files loop above is `[ -f "$f" ] || continue`, so deleting the
  # script removes a line from the output and nothing else. The file existing and
  # the contract holding are different claims, and only the second one is worth

  # What it checks per Dockerfile, because each of the three is a way this has
  # silently stopped being true:
  #
  #   1. the final `ENTRYPOINT` names the entrypoint script. A template edited
  #      back to a bare `ENTRYPOINT ["/app/service"]` is exactly the regression
  #      this packet exists to reverse, and it is a one-line diff that looks like
  #      tidying.
  #   2. the final `ENTRYPOINT` still carries the SERVICE command after the
  #      script. An `ENTRYPOINT` that ends at the script execs nothing; the
  #      script refuses to start with no arguments, so the container crash-loops
  #      on a perfectly good image.
  #   3. the script itself is present, so (1) cannot be satisfied by a name.
  #
  # Read as text with a regex, not with a Dockerfile parser, for the reason
  # `docker_rules` gives two paragraphs earlier: these templates use ARG
  # interpolation, so the claim is about the shape of the last ENTRYPOINT, not
  # about a resolved image reference.

# The backend set and the component type are asserted SEPARATELY, and the second
# one was wrong as first written. This check originally pinned the literal set
# {"otlp/tempo", "otlp/loki", "otlp/mimir", "debug"} — all three gRPC — and went
# red against a correct config, because the three backends do NOT agree on wire
# protocol: Tempo accepts OTLP over gRPC on :4317, while Loki's and Mimir's native
# OTLP receivers are HTTP-only, mounted at `/otlp` on :3100 and :8080. A gRPC
# exporter pointed at either of them fails to connect, which is a broken stack
# that still satisfies "the only exporter is debug".
#
# So the claim under test is "these backends and nothing else", and the

# half-removed. Dropping its name from this tuple is the check following the tree
# out; the tuple is a CLOSED set either way, so an exporter for a store that does
# not exist is still `unexpected exporter(s)` and one added to the tree has to be
# added here too, in the same commit, or this goes red.

  # THE REDACTION BOUNDARY, DERIVED FROM core's SCHEMAS.
  #
  # This is the check that makes "kit's collector is the enforcement point" a
  # fact rather than an intention. core owns the allowlist
  # (schemas/telemetry/traces.schema.json, metrics.schema.json, logs.schema.json
  # and redaction.schema.json); this repo's collector config is supposed to be a
  # projection of it. A projection that disagrees is not a style difference: it
  # is either an attribute core says may not be recorded, shipping anyway, or an
  # attribute a service is allowed to record being dropped on the floor.
  #
  # The comparison is BIDIRECTIONAL on purpose, and that is the part worth
  # defending:
  #
  #   core -> kit   every attribute name core allows on a signal appears in that
  #                 signal's `redaction/*` allowed_keys. A missing one is a
  #                 silently-attribute-less span, which is the failure nobody
  #                 notices because the span still arrives.
  #   kit -> core   every name in allowed_keys is either on core's list for that
  #                 signal or on core's fleet-wide redaction allowlist, and
  #                 carries no word core's schema forbids. An extra one is a
  #                 leak with a check attached to it.
  #
  # One direction would be a check that passes on an empty allowlist. Both
  # directions together is a check that fails on a wrong one.
  #
  # A DERIVED rather than a hand-maintained claim: the comparison is computed
  # from core's files on disk at gate time, so the day core changes an allowlist
  # the gate goes red here and names the name. The resolved core commit is
  # printed, because "it passed" against a spec from six weeks ago is not the

#
# The redaction processor's `allowed_keys` and `ignored_keys` are BOTH flat
# lists, and they are applied to resource attributes and measurement attributes
# by the same rule - so `ignored_keys: [tenant_id]` exempts the resource AND
# every data point, and the data point is exactly what core's metrics schema
# prohibits. Verified against the pinned image rather than assumed, because this
# is the one place an assumption is completely invisible: the pipeline runs, the
# dashboard renders, and the breakdown quietly undercounts.
#
# WHICH resource attributes can safely go in `ignored_keys` is DERIVED from
# core, not declared here. A name is safe exactly when core does not also list it
# on a signal's allowlist. `service.name` qualifies: it is never a measurement
# attribute, so exempting it cannot weaken the metrics boundary. `tenant_id` and
# `account_id` are the names core puts in BOTH places, and they are the ones
# that have to go through the stash.
#
# Four things are asserted, and (2) and (3) are the ones that stop the exemption
# being the bug:
#   1. every resource attribute core defines is either safely ignorable or
#      stashed - otherwise it is stripped and the per-tenant totals are lost;
#   2. no name core lists on BOTH a resource and a signal allowlist appears in
#      ignored_keys - that single entry is what exempts a data point too;
#   3. an ignored name core does not define anywhere is reported, because an
#      exemption nobody reasoned about is how a prohibited identifier gets back
#      onto a measurement in six months;
#   4. the stash/restore bracket the redaction processor, positionally.

  # THE CONNECTION CONTRACT, ASSERTED AGAINST GENERATED OUTPUT, PER LANGUAGE.
  #
  #   A comment saying "remember to set prepare: :unnamed" is not a contract.
  #   A comment saying "do NOT set it, and here is why" PLUS a check that fails
  #   the build when it appears is one.
  #
  # Two directions, both load-bearing, both read from
  # templates/database/contract.json so the requirements live in one file rather
  # than being restated per language:
  #
  #   REQUIRED — every generated config carries application_name,
  #   statement_timeout, idle_in_transaction_session_timeout, and a bounded
  #   pool. A service missing one is unbounded on a shared cluster.
  #
  #   FORBIDDEN — no generated config carries a pooler workaround. This is the
  #   half that catches the real failure: a service carrying `prepare:
  #   :unnamed` or `default_query_exec_mode=simple_protocol` LOOKS correct, is
  #   wrong (kit runs no pooler), and is measurably slower, and the only way to
  #   notice is to look for the flag. See templates/database/README.md.
  #
  # The requirements are matched as TOKENS over the file's text rather than
  # executed, and that is the honest bar: five of the six settings are
  # connection-string or builder arguments whose effect is Postgres's, not the
  # driver's, and asserting them by running them would mean standing up a
  # cluster per language. What IS executed is the claim that would be cheap to
  # fake — that each snippet parses in its own language — which is the same split
  # `snippet_check` and the otel parse loop already make.

def strip_comments(src, lang):
    """`src` with its COMMENTS removed, per language.

    Exists because a required setting can be named in prose and not set in code,
    and a substring test cannot tell the two apart. Measured: the go snippet's
    header comment reads "1. application_name — THE ONE THAT IS NOT OPTIONAL",
    so deleting the one line that sets it left the contract satisfied and
    self-test breakage 72 green.

    The rules, and the reasoning behind each:

      * go / elixir / node / rust  — `//` to end of line. Elixir is the awkward
        one: a `#` starts a comment there too, and `#{}` is interpolation, so a
        `#` is only a comment when it is NOT inside `{}`.
      * python                     — `#` to end of line.
      * ruby (a `.yml`)            — `#` to end of line. The ruby snippet is
        DATA, so this strips YAML comments; it is not ERB, because the file holds
        `<%= ENV.fetch(…) %>` as a plain scalar.
      * sql                        — `--` to end of line. Added for the tenancy
        substrate, whose comments quote nearly every required string while
        explaining why it exists; a check that read that file as text would report
        the whole contract satisfied on a substrate with none of it.

    String literals are NOT tracked, and that is the conservative choice in the
    right direction: a comment marker inside a string is left in place, so the
    code that follows it is still scanned and a real setting is still found. The
    failure this could cause is a false NEGATIVE — a setting missed because a
    `#` in a string opened a comment that ran to end of line — and every one of
    the six snippets' settings is on its own line above such a marker, so it
    survives. The opposite error, eating code that carries a setting, would make
    this check red on a correct tree.

  # THE ACCOUNT BOUNDARY, ASSERTED AGAINST THE TEMPLATES THAT ENFORCE IT.
  #
  #   The isolation templates are a contract in the same sense the connection
  #   contract is, and they are checked in the same place, for the same reason: a
  #   comment saying "remember FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY" is not a contract, and a
  #   comment saying "do NOT set prepare: :unnamed, and here is why" plus a check
  #   that fails the build when it appears IS one.
  #
  # FOUR DIRECTIONS, and the last two are the ones that make the first two mean
  # something:
  #
  #   REQUIRED in substrate.sql, over CODE. Measured rather than argued: the
  #   substrate's own comments quote nearly every required string while explaining
  #   why it exists, so a check that read the file as text would report the whole
  #   contract satisfied on a substrate containing none of it. This is the
  #   `-count=1` rule — "a check that a comment can satisfy is not a check" —
  #   and self-test breakage 72 is the recipe that proved it has to be done.
  #
  #   FORBIDDEN in substrate.sql, for the four shapes that make a policy
  #   decorative. Also over code, for the same reason.
  #
  #   THE SPINE IS CONSTRUCTED. Every name in `tenancy.isolation.spine` has to
  #   appear in isolation.sql AND in assertions.txt. A manifest naming an
  #   assertion the script never makes is a manifest reporting completeness for a
  #   proof that does not contain it, and that is the failure a list-of-names was
  #   introduced to prevent.
  #
  #   THE TWO FILES AGREE. Read assertions.txt and isolation.sql and fail on a
  #   difference in EITHER direction. This is `assert the AGREEMENT, not the
  #   presence of a file`: both existing is not the claim, both existing and
  #   naming the same twenty-four assertions is.
  #
  #   EVERY DRIVER OPENS BOTH FILES AT RUNTIME, and the check looks for the READ
  #   rather than the mention. A driver that names `assertions.txt` in a comment
  #   and never opens it asserts completeness about nothing — which is the failure
  #   ESLint's `reportUnusedDisableDirectives` exists for, in a language where the
  #   directive is prose.

#     appears in nine files; without it the closing backtick is skipped and the
#     next English word reads as a command;
#   * an ARGUMENT PLACEHOLDER has to be tolerated, because the four files naming
#     `bin/dev db grant` all name it as `` `bin/dev db grant <name>` ``;
#   * a word belongs to the invocation only when what FOLLOWS it is another word,

  # KIT'S OWN HARNESSES DECLARE A TENANT, without needing a docker daemon.
  #
  # This check exists because of a regression that 214 static checks and 86
  # self-test proofs all passed straight through. Removing the `:-` fallback from
  # `KIT_POSTGRES_DATABASES` was correct — a template that defaults the tenant
  # list to one of its own services hands every adopter that forgets to declare
  # itself somebody else's database, and identity asked for `identity` and got
  # `courier`. But `tests/stack_live_test.sh` is a CONSUMER of that template, and
  # it had never declared one. Nothing static looked: every other check in this
  # file reads the template or a service's committed files, and kit's own test
  # harnesses are none of those.
  #
  # The live test caught it, in 10 minutes, with a docker daemon and eight
  # containers. This catches the same mistake in about a second with neither.
  #
  # WHAT IT DOES NOT DO, because the version that did this was wrong twice. It
  # does not grep for the string `KIT_POSTGRES_DATABASES` — `templates/compose/
  # .env.example` mentions that name in prose, and `tests/stack_live_test.sh`
  # mentions it in a comment, so a substring search is satisfied by text
  # describing the variable rather than by an assignment of it. It finds the
  # ASSIGNMENT, at the start of a line, with a value, and it reads the heredoc
  # body rather than the whole file, because a real assignment outside the
  # heredoc would not reach the `.env` either.
  #
  # The rule it enforces: any file under tests/ that writes a `.env` carrying a
  # `KIT_` variable must declare a tenant in the same heredoc. That is derived

  # Elixir: a `.exs` file is EVALUATED, not merely compiled, so this is a real
  # load. The snippet is written to be loadable with the standard library alone
  # — it defines the settings module and deliberately does NOT define the
  # `Courier.Repo` module, because `use Ecto.Repo` needs a dependency kit must
  # not have and a module that cannot compile is a module the gate cannot check.
  # The bar is therefore "loads with no CompileError and no SyntaxError", and
  # the error COUNT rather than a grep for the word "error", because warnings
  # about unresolved modules contain that word too.
  #
  # This shipped wrong twice. It first ran through the generic loop, which
  # reported the snippet's own `use Ecto.Repo` as a syntax error; and it then
  # reported a CompileError that was in fact an unresolved module. Both were the
  # same mistake — treating a missing DEPENDENCY as a parse failure.

  # THE FLEET GATE, and it is RED on master. That is the point, and the shape is
  # the same as D4: three repositories that do not spell the same gate the same
  # way is invisible to any check that reads only one of them, so kit's gate
  # reads the OTHER repositories rather than trusting that they adopted it.
  #
  # Four failure modes, one check each, in tests/fleet_check.py:
  #   - a service carrying a copy of the shared infrastructure
  #   - a service that weakened the redaction boundary
  #   - an otel-collector.yml that exists but that nothing ever starts
  #   - a pin that is unpinned, or points at a branch
  #
  # IT SKIPS LOUDLY WHEN THERE IS NO FLEET, and that is not a detail. A clone of
  # kit on CI has no siblings, and "no fleet was found" is not "the fleet is
  # clean" — the same `unknown` vs `current` confusion tests/staleness.py exists
  # to avoid. A gate that reports the second when it means the first is a gate
  # that gets muted, and this one is going to be red a lot on purpose.
  #
  # `KIT_FLEET` is the seam, and it exists so self_test.sh can point the check at
  # a FIXTURE fleet. Without it every breakage below would depend on the real
  # fleet being present and dirty, which is a proof that passes when the fleet is
  # absent — the exact shape this repository keeps warning about.
  #
  # The SKIP decision is `fleet_check.py`'s, not this file's, and the reason is a
  # disagreement that was real. The first version guarded the call with its own
  # "are there any sibling entries?" test — `ls -A ..` minus kit's own worktrees.
  # A self-test's throwaway directory HAS sibling entries (one per breakage) and
  # none of them is a repository, so the guard said "there is a fleet", ran the
  # check, and the check exited 2 with "no cafaye repositories". The self-test's
  # CONTROL would have gone red, which D13 treats as blocking the packet, for a
  # reason that has nothing to do with the packet.
  #
  # So there is exactly one predicate for "is there a fleet", it lives beside the
  # code that knows what a repository is, and it answers with a machine-readable
  # marker. `check` cannot express three outcomes, which is why this is written
  # out rather than delegated: a SKIP is not a PASS that happened quietly.
  #
  # THE ADOPTION CEILING, and it is the fourth outcome this block has to express.
  # `fleet_check.py` answers three questions and this file must not collapse
  # them: is there a fleet (SKIP), is any ADOPTING repository defective (FAIL),
  # and is any UNADOPTED repository carrying debt (PASS, with the debt printed).
  # The three outcomes are read off the exit code plus the `CEILING fleet:` line
  # the check always prints, rather than from a fourth flag, because a fourth
  # flag is a fourth thing to keep in step with the check that emits it.
  #
  # WHY A PASS CAN CARRY FINDINGS, and why this is not the softening the packet
  # refuses. The strictness has not moved anywhere weaker; it has moved to WHERE
  # ADOPTION EXISTS. The same four predicates, the same messages, the same
  # severity — and the moment a repository commits `git -C ../kit rev-parse HEAD
  # > kit.ref`, every finding inside it becomes a FAIL with no discretion and no
  # re-review. A gate that stays red for thirteen findings no repository has
  # agreed to fix is a gate whose red stops being read, and a gate nobody reads
  # catches nothing. This is core-16's shape for a missing OpenAPI document, and
  # it is a WAVE, not a discount: each repository's adoption converts its own
  # named debt into a failure.
  #
  # The count is printed because a ceiling with no number on it cannot be
  # argued about: "PASS" and "PASS with 13 named warnings across 6 repositories"
  # are different statements, and only the second is true.

  # THE COLLECTOR CONFIG IS MOUNTED FROM THE TREE `bin/dev` FETCHED, and this is
  # the check for a defect that ONLY RUNNING THE STACK could find.
  #
  # `templates/compose/otel-collector.yml` carries the redaction allowlist. Once
  # the file is no longer copied into the service, the compose file must mount it
  # from `${KIT_COMPOSE_DIR:-.}`, and `bin/dev` must set that variable to the
  # FETCHED tree. Get either half wrong and nothing above notices: the compose
  # file parses, `docker compose config` renders the same project either way, and
  # every static check in this file stays green — because the value of the
  # variable is not a property of the YAML.
  #
  # What it actually does when it is wrong: the mount resolves to a path that does
  # not exist, and Docker's answer to a missing bind source is to CREATE A
  # DIRECTORY. The collector then exits naming a file type:
  #
  #   failed to read configFile /etc/tempo/tempo.yaml: is a directory
  #
  # which says nothing about the thing that is wrong, and arrives four containers
  # after a stack that was supposed to come up. `tests/stack_live_test.sh` is what
  # found it, by bringing the fetched stack up and reading the collector's own
  # mount back with `docker inspect`. This check is the static half of the same
  # property, so the defect cannot be re-introduced between one live run and the
  # next.
  #
  # It asserts BOTH halves. Checking the compose file alone would pass on a
  # `bin/dev` that stopped exporting `KIT_COMPOSE_DIR`; checking `bin/dev` alone
  # would pass on a compose file that stopped using the variable. The defect is

#     only two bare paths in the file, and the only two that were wrong.
#
#     What they cost, measured on identity rather than reasoned about: `bin/dev`
#     runs compose with `--project-directory .`, the SERVICE root, and Docker
#     Compose resolves a relative bind source and build context against the
#     PROJECT DIRECTORY, not against the directory holding the compose file. So

  # -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # THE SEAM IS NARROW, AND "NARROW" IS A LIST SOMEONE CAN SHORTEN.
  # -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  #
  # `lint-args` is the deviation seam, and the workflow says in three places
  # what it may not be used for. A promise in a comment is not a control, and the
  # first version of this file PROMISED a control that did not exist: the
  # input's own comment said `lint_wiring_check` "fails on exactly that string",
  # and `lint_wiring_check` had no such assertion anywhere in it.
  #
  # The reason is structural and it is worth stating, because it decides where
  # the control lives: **`lint-args` is the CALLER's value.** kit's gate can see
  # that the input exists, that it is a string, and that it defaults to empty. It
  # cannot see what a service put in it, because kit has never got it. So the
  # rule that makes the seam narrow has to run in the service — the
  # `lint-args guard` step, which every lint job has.
  #
  # Which leaves exactly the failure this check exists for: three hand-maintained
  # copies of a policy block, in a repository whose own rule is that duplicated
  # policy blocks are only safe while something reads them. This asserts all
  # three: that the guard is in each lint job, that the three bodies are
  # byte-identical, that the guard runs BEFORE the linter (a guard after it is
  # decoration — the lint has already had its chance), that the linter actually
  # receives the variable (a guard over a value nothing passes on is a guard over
  # nothing), and that the forbidden token list is the one written here.
  #
  # The last of those is the one that matters most. Without it, deleting
  # `--no-config` from the guard's `case` list is a one-token edit that widens
  # the seam for every service in the fleet and leaves the workflow looking
  # exactly as it did before.

  # THE DRIFT CHECK. A service that carries a lint config INCONSISTENT with
  # kit's is the failure this packet exists to end, and it is invisible from
  # both sides: kit cannot see the service's tree, and the service's CI goes
  # green the whole time.
  #
  # WHY IT IS NOT "THE FILE MUST NOT EXIST". That version is easier to write and
  # it is wrong in a way that costs more than the drift it prevents. A service
  # whose `.golangci.yml` is byte-identical to kit's has not drifted; it has
  # arrived at the same policy by another route, and failing it teaches the
  # lesson that kit's config is a thing you get shouted at for having. The
  # check a moment later asserts exactly this, as breakage 27b's GREEN control.
  #
  # So this READS BOTH FILES and reports THE DIFFERENCE, linter by linter. A
  # reader of the failure message learns which linters the service turned off
  # and which it added, which is the only information anyone can act on. A check
  # that only said "unexpected file" would send someone to `diff` by hand.
  #
  # SCOPE, and it is a real limitation rather than a convenient one: this reads
  # the kit working tree plus whatever service checkouts are present beside it
  # (`../<repo>`), which is how every other fleet-shaped check in this file
  # works — `core_repo()` above is the same shape. With no sibling checkout the
  # check SKIPS loudly and says which environment variable points at one. It is
  # never silently green, because a drift check that could not have run and
  # reported nothing is the same class of defect as a lint step that cannot fail.
  # The fleet directories, one per line, that CALL the reusable workflow. A
  # service repo is one that calls it: a repository that does not is not
  # governed by kit's policy, and reporting drift in it would be noise that
  # trains people to ignore this check.

# The service-side filenames this check READS. Two facts measured on
# golangci-lint v2.6.2, and the first one corrected a claim this file made
# before it was run:
#
#   1. DISCOVERY IS THE FALLBACK, NOT THE OVERRIDE. `golangci-lint run -v`
#      prints `[config_reader] Used config file <path>`, and it is decisive: with
#      `--config=<kit>` it names kit's file and nothing else, and without the
#      flag it names the repo-root one. A repo-root `.golangci.yml` that
#      disables `misspell` is INERT under `--config` — the misspelling is still
#      reported. This file previously claimed the opposite, that discovery
#      "beats every flag", and that claim was the whole justification for
#      reporting drift. It was wrong.
#   2. So a stale copy does NOT hijack kit's CI. What it does is split the
#      policy: every OTHER golangci-lint invocation in that repository — a
#      developer's `golangci-lint run`, an editor integration, a `make lint`, a
#      pre-commit hook — reads the local file, while kit's CI reads kit's. Two
#      policies in one repository, one of them enforced nowhere it is written
#      down. And the copy becomes live again the moment the `--config` flag goes
#      missing, which is breakage 29, and silently, because a copy is always
#      weaker than the thing it was copied from.
#
# The check is therefore not "the file hijacks the build". It is "the file and
# kit disagree, and only one of the two is what CI runs" — which is a real
# finding, and an honest one.
#
# `eslint.config.mjs` is deliberately NOT here, and now for a measured reason
# rather than a rhetorical one: ESLint's `--config` also wins outright, and a
# service's own `eslint.config.mjs` is only read by something that points at it.
# The two linters behave the same way, so the difference between listing it and
# not listing it is intent, not mechanics: a repo's own ESLint config is a
# legitimate thing to own, and this check is about copies of KIT's policy.

#
# RULE 4 IS SCOPED TO THE REPOSITORIES THIS RUN ACTUALLY LOOKED AT, and that
# scoping is the whole correctness of the rule rather than a softening of it.
# "This entry no longer describes a difference" is a claim about a file, and the
# only way to make it is to have read that file. A repository that is not in the
# fleet beside this checkout has NOT been read, so nothing is known about it, and
# reporting its entry as unused is a check inventing a finding out of its own
# ignorance.
#
# It is not a theoretical concern. It fired the moment this file was finished:
# `tests/self_test.sh` runs this gate against a throwaway COPY of kit, and a
# copy's fleet is itself rather than the cafaye directory, so every entry in the
# allowlist named a repository that was not present — and the gate went red on a
# perfectly correct tree, telling the reader to delete debt that had not been
# discharged. A rule that cries wolf in its own test suite is a rule people
# learn to bypass with `--no-`, which is the failure this packet exists to end.
#
# The consequence is stated rather than hidden: a repository DELETED from the
# fleet leaves an entry nothing can flag. That is a real limit and it is paid
# for deliberately, because the alternative is a gate that is red whenever kit is
# checked out on its own — which is every fresh clone and every CI runner. What
# covers the deleted case is `tests/staleness.py`, which reports a repository
# that calls kit and is not resolvable; this file covers the case where the
# repository is HERE and no longer differs, and the two are not the same
# question.
# Whether this run can speak about a repository it did not see, and the answer
# is not the same in the two situations kit runs in.
#
#   - A REAL checkout: the scan found the fleet, so a repository in the
#     allowlist that the scan did NOT find is a repository that has been deleted,
#     renamed, or renamed away. That is a finding, and it is the case rule 4
#     exists for: the entry is dead weight and nobody will notice without it.
#   - A COPY of kit, which is what `tests/self_test.sh` runs the gate against
#     twenty-odd times: the only "fleet" beside it is itself, because a copy has
#     no cafaye directory next to it. Nothing can be said about `identity` there,
#     and reporting its entry as dead would be the check inventing a finding out
#     of its own ignorance — red on a perfectly correct tree, telling the reader
#     to delete debt that has not been discharged. It fired the moment this file
#     was finished, on the gate's own test suite.
#
# So the two are told apart by asking whether the scan found anything other than
# this checkout, which is a fact about the run rather than a flag someone can set
# to make the check quiet.

  # (3b) The PARITY allowlist, and the artefact table it is checked against.
  #
  #     Same four hygiene rules as the tier skip allowlist above, in the same

  #     NEW here is the other direction, and it is the one that matters most:
  #
  #     AN UNPINNED DIVERGENCE OR ABSENCE IS A FAILURE.
  #
  #     The tier allowlist does not need that rule because its entries name
  #     tests that are either present or absent for reasons the file's own
  #     comments explain. This one names copies in repositories kit cannot see
  #     at gate time, so the file is a RECORD OF THE FLEET, and a record that
  #     silently omits a cell is worse than no record: it reads as "handled".

  #     ledger to shrink. Deleting an entry to make the count go down is a
  #     failure of its own, and the reporter catches it against the fleet.

  #     whose verb is not a verb the reporter can report. The rest — an unpinned

  #     the fleet, and is proven by `tests/staleness_test.sh` against a fixture
  #     fleet rather than asserted here. Saying so is the point: a check that

  # kit's own licence, and the one property about it that can rot.
  #
  # WHY THIS EXISTS. kit carried no `LICENSE` at all while the rest of the fleet
  # was being given one, and the state that produces is not "unlicensed" — it is
  # "all rights reserved", because that is the default copyright position when a
  # public repository grants nothing. cafaye's decision is MIT everywhere, and a
  # decision that is written down on a website and absent from the repository is
  # a decision a buyer's own legal review cannot see.
  #
  # The interesting half is not the file. It is that a licence is only
  # unambiguous when there is exactly ONE place in a repository that can declare
  # one, and that place is easy to lose: a `package.json` appears, it carries
  # `"license": "AGPL-3.0-only"` copied out of a service, and now the repository
  # says MIT in one file and AGPL in another. Both are true statements about
  # different fields, and the reader has no way to tell which one a licence
  # compliance tool reads.
  #
  # So this asserts the AGREEMENT, not the presence of a file:
  #
  #   1. `LICENSE` exists and grants MIT, recognised by the grant's own words
  #      rather than by the string "MIT" — a file saying "MIT" and granting
  #      something else passes every check that looks for the word, and this is
  #      the check that looks for the words.
  #   2. it names a copyright holder, because MIT's attribution obligation is
  #      that notice travelling with the software, and a grant with no holder is
  #      a grant nobody can attribute.
  #   3. README says MIT and links the file. A grant nobody reads is not
  #      published, and the two licence questions in kit's README are separate
  #      on purpose (MIT for kit, AGPL-3.0 for the four backends it ships
  #      unmodified) — so the check asserts against kit's OWN paragraph and
  #      leaves the AGPL one alone, since conflating the two is the mistake the
  #      README's structure exists to prevent.
  #   4. every root manifest that CAN carry a licence field declares MIT.
  #
  # Point 4 is deliberately a check for AGREEMENT and not a ban on the file. The
  # same reasoning as breakage 31b: a check satisfied by "kit has no
  # package.json" would train the next contributor to delete a manifest rather
  # than to fix its licence field, and would be a FAIL the day kit legitimately
  # grew one. Today it finds zero manifests and prints that count, because "0
  # manifests, none of which can disagree" is a measurement and silence is not.

  # THE VERSION STRING IS THE PROMISE, AND IT IS DERIVED
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  #
  # kit is adopted by COPY and by `uses:` at a ref, so "is 2.4.0 safe to take?"
  # is the only question a consumer has, and until this check it was answered by
  # a person reading a diff. kit also had no version at all: the changelog said
  # so in its own first paragraph ("kit has no releases yet and no semver
  # contract"), which is an honest sentence and an unusable one — the tier was
  # documentation, so nothing could fail when the documentation was wrong.
  #
  # `VERSION` is one line and it is the ONLY place the version is written. Three
  # tiers, derived from the two versions and never asserted anywhere:
  #
  #   breaking   MAJOR moved. A consumer must read what changed, and must be
  #              given a MIGRATION, because "read the diff" is the thing this
  #              whole mechanism exists to stop asking of people.
  #   additive   MINOR moved. Something was added; nothing a consumer holds was
  #              taken away.
  #   invisible  PATCH moved. A consumer may take it without reading anything,
  #              which is what "invisible" has to mean for it to be worth
  #              deriving.
  #
  # WHY THESE THREE, AND NOT FOUR, AND NOT A BOOLEAN
  #
  # The rule of thumb is that the number you do NOT have to read is the size of
  # the promise, so the tiers have to be the three sizes of change there are.
  # A fourth tier would be a claim about something this repository cannot
  # observe — the difference between "invisible" and "safe" is a difference
  # about the CONSUMER's code, which kit does not have. And a boolean
  # (`breaking: true|false`) is what cafaye has today and it is what the
  # research calls the weakest form of this: it answers "did anything break?"
  # with one bit, so it cannot say WHICH surface broke, so a consumer reading it
  # still has to open the diff. The tier is derived from the number the consumer
  # already has, which is the property that makes it checkable at all.
  #
  # WHY A VERSION STRING THIS CHECK REFUSES
  #
  # `2.4.0-rc1` and `v2.4.0` are BOTH refused rather than guessed at, and both
  # refusals are deliberate:
  #   * a prerelease suffix is exactly where "what tier is this" stops having an
  #     answer — semver puts `2.4.0-rc1` BELOW `2.4.0`, which means the derived
  #     tier would change meaning when the suffix is dropped, so the string stops
  #     being the source of truth for its own promise. kit has no prerelease
  #     story and a refused version string is the honest answer to "which tier is
  #     rc1 in", where guessing is the expensive one.
  #   * `v` is the TAG spelling, not the version spelling. `kit.ref` accepts
  #     `v<semver>` because that is a git tag, and this file is not a git tag.
  #     A `v` here means somebody pasted the tag where the version goes, which
  #     is precisely the hand-written-number drift this replaces.
  #
  # Both surface as `unknown`, and `unknown` is a FAILURE. A string the
  # function cannot place must not be given a tier, because a tier that is a
  # guess is the fail-open direction and this repository's rule is to fail
  # closed.
  #
  # WHY THE DERIVATION IS A FUNCTION AND NOT PROSE
  #
  # A table in this comment is a table somebody can read and nobody has to
  # agree with. `stability_tier` is asserted against a published table by the
  # check below it, so a change to the rule that is not a change to the table is
  # a red gate — and that is the whole difference between a standard and a
  # convention.

  # kit-02 shipped a reusable workflow at `workflows/ci.reusable.yml`, a README
  # telling every reader to write
  #
  #     uses: cafaye/kit/workflows/ci.reusable.yml@master
  #
  # and GitHub, which does not support subdirectories of the workflows
  # directory, resolving that to nothing. Every check in this file was green
  # for the whole of that time. A layout bug and a documentation bug that agree
  # with each other are invisible to any check that reads only one of them, and
  # the file they disagreed about is the one thirteen repos were told to depend
  # on.
  #
  # So this asserts the agreement directly, in the places it can drift:
  #
  #   1. the file is at the path callers are told to use
  #   2. it declares `on: workflow_call` (parseable, and actually callable)
  #   3. every real `uses:` that names kit — in the docs' fenced yaml blocks and
  #      in this repo's own workflow files — is exactly that path, cross-repo
  #      with a ref, or local with `./` for kit calling itself
  #   4. kit's own CI calls it with the LOCAL form, so the self-proof is a
  #      self-proof and not a network fetch of some other ref
  #   5. there is exactly one copy of it in the tree
  #
  # Point 5 is not paranoia. A mirror — canonical file here, callable copy
  # there — is one of the two layouts the packet offered, and it is only
  # acceptable with a check that fails when the copies differ. kit chose the
  # move, so this walks the tree and refuses to find a second one. Same
  # reasoning as the outbox/`registries` duplication this repo already refuses.
  #
  # Only *executable* call sites are read: the `uses:` keys of parsed yaml.
  # Prose that quotes a wrong path to explain why it is wrong — which README
  # and AGENTS.md both now do — is not a call site, and a check that flags its

  # `options:` list under its `workflow_call` `language` input. `options` is a
  # `workflow_dispatch` feature; `workflow_call` inputs accept only
  # `description`, `required`, `type` and `default`. GitHub rejects the ENTIRE
  # FILE at parse time for an unknown key — not the one input, the file — so
  # every job in it failed to start, for every caller, in every repository.
  #
  # WHY NOTHING CAUGHT IT FOR TWO DAYS. Every check in this gate read the
  # workflow as TEXT and every one of them was satisfied: the file existed, it
  # declared `workflow_call`, the documented call matched, the inputs matched.
  # What none of them asked was whether the file is a workflow GitHub can run.
  # Meanwhile the run summary said only "This run likely failed because of a
  # workflow file issue" and the check suite reported zero check runs, so the
  # badge was red in a way that looked like infrastructure rather than like a
  # defect in the tree. Every static check was green throughout.
  #
  # WHAT THIS CHECK IS, PRECISELY, because a check that claims more than it does
  # is the defect it exists to catch. It is NOT a GitHub Actions schema
  # validator and it will not catch every way a workflow can be invalid — it
  # cannot know about expression contexts, runner labels, or a `uses:` that
  # resolves to nothing. It asserts ONE property, and the one it asserts is the
  # one that was actually violated: every key directly under a `workflow_call`
  # input is one GitHub documents for that event.
  #
  # `options` is named in the message because it is the key that was written, it
  # is the one every author reaches for, and a message naming the key is a
  # message the next author can act on.

  # The toolchain floor, checked BEFORE any suite runs.
  #
  # Written because of what this phase did on a machine with a system Ruby
  # 2.6.10 on PATH: the suite ran, three tests raised `NoMethodError: undefined
  # method 'filter_map'`, and the summary said
  #
  #     FAIL templates/otel/ruby  (ruby test suite)
  #
  # which is a false accusation. Nothing is wrong with the template. The
  # interpreter on PATH was older than the one construct the template uses, and
  # `Array#filter_map` is a RUNTIME call, so the failure arrives as a stack
  # trace from inside a helper rather than as a refusal to run. Every other
  # language here fails loudly on its own — go's go.mod plus GOTOOLCHAIN=local,
  # rustc's --edition, python's `from __future__ import annotations` — so this
  # was the only one that could report a wrong answer instead of no answer.
  #
  # The floor is a FEATURE PROBE, not a version number, and that is the whole
  # design. A literal like `2.7` in this file is a claim about the template
  # that nothing checks: raise the template's floor and the claim rots; the
  # probe is derived from the same call the suite makes, so the two cannot
  # disagree. It is a probe rather than a version comparison because the
  # interesting question is not "how old is this ruby" but "can it run the code
  # we ship" — which is answerable exactly, and which a version string can only
  # approximate.
  #
  # FAIL, not SKIP. A too-old interpreter is not an absent one: the suite is
  # installed, the code is here, and the check is genuinely unrun. Reporting
  # SKIP would make the gate green having verified nothing about ruby — the
  # "a gate that skips is not green" rule, and the direction this repo's own
  # fail-closed discipline points. An ABSENT toolchain is still a SKIP: that is

  #
  # `2b` is parsed as a letter-suffixed continuation of 2 and is expected to
  # appear on both sides, so it is compared literally rather than dropped.
  #
  # EVERYTHING IS A STRING. The first version of this check expanded `7-10` with
  # `range(int(lo), int(hi) + 1)`, so those entries entered the set as `int` while
  # the single entries arrived from the regex as `str`. `named - carried` then
  # reported 7, 8, 9, 10 and every two-digit breakage as both documented-without-
  # a-recipe AND proven-without-being-documented — which is the check reporting a
  # disagreement that did not exist, on a tree that was correct. Normalising to
  # `str` at every point of entry is the whole fix, and the reason it is worth
  # stating: a set difference over two representations of the same number is
  # never empty, so the failure mode is a permanently red check, not a missed one.
  #
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # AND THE SECOND PROPERTY ABOUT THE SAME FILE: no recipe needs the live tier,
  # and every child gate opts out of it through ONE wrapper. Both are derived
  # here rather than asserted in `self_test.sh`'s header, because the header is
  # exactly the kind of claim this repository stops believing: a comment saying
  # "the child gates do not run docker" is a comment, and the thing that failed
  # was a docker tier that ran anyway for twenty-odd whole gates.
  #
  # THREE THINGS ARE CHECKED, and each answers a way this can rot:
  #
  #   1. `bash tests/validate.sh` appears EXACTLY ONCE in `self_test.sh`, in a
  #      non-comment line. Five helpers spawn child gates; a sixth added without
  #      the opt-out is a whole gate that quietly brings up three docker stacks
  #      again, and the suite gets slower and flakier with nothing to read.
  #   2. That one line sets `KIT_NO_LIVE=1` and lives inside `kit_child_gate`, so
  #      the single place is also the place that knows what the opt-out is.
  #   3. ZERO recipe invocations mention a live tier. The live set is READ from
  #      this file's own `live_check` calls rather than written out here, so a
  #      fourth live tier is covered by the same check on the day it lands, and
  #      the list can never name a script that has been renamed.
  #
  # (3) is the count this packet asked for, as a check rather than as a claim:
  # today it is 0, and it is 0 because every recipe asserts a verdict about ONE
  # named check — a collector config, a workflow, a linter, a reporter — and the
  # observability live tier is not one of them. It is 0 for a second reason the
  # count cannot see. Counted on this tree: of the 107 recipe invocations, 93 run
  # the gate at all (6 `expect_red_lang` and 8 `_script` invocations never do),
  # **84 of the 93 pass `--static-only`**, and the other 9 are all narrowed to
  # the single check they assert by `expect_red_check`'s `--only` — except 23b,
  # whose helper cannot be filtered because the string it must find is a SKIP's
  # verdict text rather than a check's label. So the opt-out changes the output

  # the self-test is _n_ gates in sequence: 77 on this branch, and the number
  # grows with every check this repository adds. On a quiet box it is the
  # longest phase in the run by a wide margin, and it is the one that grows
  # silently — nothing in it announces that the gate just got slower.

  # count is a claim, and this repository's rule about `DECISIONS.md` — that a
  # reference to something that does not exist is worse than no reference — is the
  # same rule one layer down.
  #
  # AND A BOUND IS NOT A RESULT ABOUT THE BREAKAGES IT DID NOT REACH. Measured on
  # kit-22: this tier BOUNDed at breakage 56 of 77, so 21 recipes never ran, and
  # the run still exited 0. That is the correct behaviour — a bound is neither a
  # pass nor a skip, and it is reported — but it means a green gate is not
  # evidence about the unreached recipes. Running them by hand is how kit-22 found
  # breakage 72 green on a check that could not see its own defect. See
  # AGENTS.md, "a BOUND self_test is a gate to run by hand".
  #
  # 5400s is measured, not chosen. The uninterrupted run recorded in
  # REPORT-kit-13.md §5.2 took ~44 minutes end to end, of which the self-test
  # phase was the majority; 5400 leaves room for a box three times busier than
  # this one without being a number so large it never binds. A bound that never
  # binds is the correct answer here — the point is that the run REACHES THE END
  # and says so, not that it fails sooner. A tier that hits its bound is reported
  # as a BOUND, which is neither a pass nor a skip, so a bound cannot buy a green
  # this tree did not earn.
