# kit's entire test suite. kit is config-only — no runtime code, no library —
# so there is nothing to exercise. The test is that every artifact a service
# repo copies or calls actually parses, and that the telemetry templates
# actually propagate a traceparent.
#
#   bash tests/validate.sh                     # the gate: static + telemetry
#   bash tests/validate.sh --static-only       # parse/semantic checks only (fast)
#   bash tests/validate.sh --language=go       # one telemetry language (CI matrix)
#   bash tests/validate.sh --no-self-test      # skip the "can this go red" proof
#
# Three phases, all of which must pass:
#   static     every artifact parses, and the strictness decisions are still
#              what we wrote them down to be (no exporter on by default, every
#              compose port parameterized, every placeholder documented).
#   telemetry  the W3C traceparent templates are EXECUTED, one suite per
#              language. This is the phase that is easy to fake and so is the
#              one that runs the code rather than greps it.
#   self_test  breaks a throwaway copy of this tree once per kind of check and asserts the
#              gate goes red each time. A gate that cannot fail is not a gate.
#
# One line per check: PASS, FAIL, or SKIP. Any FAIL exits 1. A SKIP is always
# reported in the summary — never hidden.
#
# Needs a python with PyYAML (tests/requirements.txt). node, shellcheck,
# yamllint and the six language toolchains run when present and skip when not;
# the artifact-presence and static checks always run, so a deleted template is
# a failure on a machine with no toolchains at all.

  #     uses: cafaye/kit/workflows/ci.reusable.yml@master
  #
  # and GitHub, which does not support subdirectories of the workflows

  # with each other are invisible to any check that reads only one of them, and
  # the file they disagreed about is the one thirteen repos were told to depend
  # on.
  #
  # So this asserts the agreement directly, in the places it can drift:
  #
  #   1. the file is at the path callers are told to use
  #   2. it declares `on: workflow_call` (parseable, and actually callable)
  #   3. every real `uses:` that names kit — in the docs' fenced yaml blocks and

  #      with a ref, or local with `./` for kit calling itself
  #   4. kit's own CI calls it with the LOCAL form, so the self-proof is a
