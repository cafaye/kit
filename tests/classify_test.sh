# tests/classify_test.sh — the fail-closed property, asserted rather than assumed.
#
#   bash tests/classify_test.sh
#
# WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE SCRIPT AND NOT MORE self_test CASES
#
#   `self_test.sh` breaks a copy of kit's TREE and asserts the gate goes red. That
#   is the right shape for a check that reads a file. The classifier's property is
#   different: it is a statement about what the classifier does with a pair of
#   schema DIRECTORIES, including changes no rule names. So the cases here build
#   two trees in a temp dir and run the classifier over them, which is the only
#   way to exercise the property that matters.
#
# THE PROPERTY
#
#   An unrecognised change fails. Not "fails loudly" — fails, at the strictest
#   tier, with a non-zero exit. Everything else in this file is a corollary.
#
#   The cases below are ordered so the sharpest is first and the cheapest
#   regression checks follow. `fail_closed` is the one this packet exists for: a
#   brand-new JSON Schema keyword arriving in core, which nobody wrote a rule
#   for, and which a fail-open classifier would wave through.
