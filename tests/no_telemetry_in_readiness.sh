#
# kit's proof that telemetry is never in a readiness path.
#
#   bash tests/no_telemetry_in_readiness.sh
#
# THE CLAIM
#   "A service that hangs on startup because telemetry is down is worse than no
#   telemetry at all." (PLAN.md §7b)
#
#   That sentence is easy to agree with and easy to break, and the way it
#   breaks is always the same shape: one `depends_on: [otel-collector]` added
#   for convenience, or one probe that curls the OTLP port "just to check
#   telemetry is up", and then a deploy that will not roll out because a
#   dev-local collector is not running in the cluster.
#
# WHAT IS PROVED HERE, AND IN HOW MANY PARTS
#   Four claims, in increasing order of how much they can be faked:
#
#   1. STATIC, no docker. Nothing in the shipped compose template or bin/dev
#      path waits on the collector. This is cheap and cannot be faked by a
#      runtime, but it also cannot see a probe that opens a socket.
#
#   2. LIVE, a real collector. The shipped collector is started with its three
#      exporters pointed at ports where NOTHING is listening — Tempo, Loki and
#      Mimir all absent — and the question is whether it reports healthy. A
#      collector that fails its health check when its backends are down has put
#      an observability store in everyone's readiness path, which is the exact
#      inversion this packet is about.
#
#   3. LIVE, the collector KILLED. A throwaway HTTP service with a `/readyz`
#      that really checks a dependency — the shape core's probes.schema.json
#      demands — is started with the collector not running, and must serve. Its
#      readiness must report ready and its liveness must report alive, because
#      a telemetry component that can flip either of those is in the path.
#
#   4. LIVE, the export path. A real service exporting OTLP to a dead endpoint
#      must keep SERVING, and the collector's absence must not make it error.
#      This is the part that catches a client library configured to fail the
#      request path on export failure, which no amount of reading this file
#      would find.
#
# NO SLEEPS. Every wait is a poll on a health or readiness signal with a
# deadline and a named timeout. A sleep is a guess about someone else's startup
# time, and it is wrong on the machine where it matters.
#
# WHY A THROWAWAY PROJECT AND A THROWAWAY PORT RANGE
#   Nothing here touches the developer's own stack, and `docker compose down -v`
#   is called on the way out so no volume survives. The ports are in 15800-15899
#   and are the ONLY ones this script binds; the shipped stack claims
#   15000-15999 and the collision-avoidance is that this script's services
#   publish nothing at all and talk over the compose network by name.

  # The shape core's probes.schema.json demands, built from a stock image so
  # the test has no dependency of its own:
  #
  #   /healthz  consults NOTHING. A liveness probe that fails on a dependency
  #             tells the orchestrator to restart a process that is fine, which
  #             turns a database outage into a fleet-wide crash RESTART LOOP and
  #             destroys the evidence needed to diagnose it.
  #   /readyz   really checks. A readyz that checks nothing is invisible,
  #             because it returns 200 and looks perfect in every dashboard.
  #
  # AND NOW IT IS PROVEN THAT readyz IS CAPABLE OF FAILING, which is the part
  # that makes the rest of this section mean anything. An earlier version of this
  # test stood up `traefik/whoami`, which answers every path with 200 — so its
  # "/readyz" could not have failed no matter what was wrong, and a test that
  # cannot fail is not a test. That image also ships no `wget`, so the probe
  # never ran at all and the section failed for a reason unrelated to the claim.
  #
  # So the service is a real one: `dep` is a listener, `svc` TCP-connects to it
  # from /readyz, and the test then STOPS `dep` and watches /readyz go 503. Only
  # after that is proven does "and it kept serving" mean anything — it means it
  # kept serving while a dependency it genuinely checks was down and an OTLP
  # endpoint that does not exist was configured.
