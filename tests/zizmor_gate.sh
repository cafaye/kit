# kit's GitHub Actions security audit, split the way MD10 ruled it.
#
#   bash tests/zizmor_gate.sh [ROOT] [ZIZMOR]
#
# ONE definition, two callers: the `zizmor` job in .github/workflows/
# ci.reusable.yml, and this repository's own gate. Same reasoning as
# gitleaks_gate.sh — a policy that is expressed twice is expressed once in CI
# and once in someone's head.
#
# WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES THAT A PLAIN `zizmor` DOES NOT
#
#   `unpinned-uses` findings are RECORDED, and nothing else is.
#
#   The fleet calls `cafaye/kit/.github/workflows/ci.reusable.yml@master`, so
#   every `uses:` in every adopting repo is a branch ref and zizmor reports
#   thirty-odd of them. Two things can be done with that, and only one of them
#   is honest:
#
#     - fix it: pin thirteen repositories to SHAs, and own the bump. The fleet
#       calls a moving ref on purpose, and the reasons are costed in DECISIONS.md.
#     - baseline it: add `unpinned-uses` to zizmor.yml's ignore list, at which
#       point zizmor stops reporting it and the trade has been made invisibly,
#       in a file whose only other purpose is a different trade.
#
#   So this script does neither. It runs the audit, counts `unpinned-uses`
#   separately, prints the count with a pointer to the decision, and fails on
#   every OTHER finding. `unpinned-uses` is therefore not fixed and not baselined
#   away: it is still measured, still printed on every run, and still the reason
#   the decision exists.
#
#   Everything else zizmor finds is a real finding and fails the build, whether
#   it is fixed in the workflow or accepted in .github/zizmor.yml with a reason.
#   That is the property that stops a blanket baseline: you cannot add a blanket,
#   because a blanket for `unpinned-uses` has nowhere to hide in — this script
#   counts it either way — and a blanket for everything else stops the job
#   finding anything at all.
#
# OFFLINE
#   zizmor's audits read workflow files. The one that does not is
#   `impostor-commit`, which queries the remote; the invocations here do not ask
#   for it. Nothing in this script reaches github.com.
