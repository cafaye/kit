# kit's proof that lint actually RUNS with kit's config, from kit, at run time.
#
#   bash tests/lint_test.sh
#
# WHAT THIS IS FOR
#   The packet that wrote `lint/` shipped 249 lines of linter configuration that
#   NO service in the fleet had ever copied, and every check in this repository
#   was green the whole time. The reason is that the checks parsed the configs
#   and nothing ever RAN a linter with them. A config that parses is a config
#   that has never been shown to accept a good file or reject a bad one.
#
#   So this is the phase that closes that hole: for each language, build a
#   throwaway service that contains a violation ONLY a linter would catch, then
#   run the SAME command the reusable workflow runs, with kit's config, and
#   assert the linter rejects it. A config that cannot reject anything is a
#   comment, and this is the check that says which of kit's four are comments.
#
# THE MECHANISMS, AND WHY THEY ARE DIFFERENT
#   Measured, not assumed — the table in README.md records the runs. The short
#   version, because the difference is the whole design:
#
#     golangci-lint  `--config=<path>`. Measured: no `.golangci.yml` in the
#                    repo means golangci-lint falls back to its own 5-linter
#                    DEFAULT set (errcheck govet ineffassign staticcheck
#                    unused) and exits 0 on a file kit's config rejects. So the
#                    config is not optional garnish; without this flag a Go
#                    service is silently on a different, weaker policy.
#                    GOLANGCI_LINT_CONFIG is NOT read by v2 — measured, it is
#                    silently ignored, and the run proceeds on the default set.
#
#     rubocop        `--config=<path>`, same shape, same reason. Measured: with
#                    no config a 13-line method passes on RuboCop's default
#                    MethodLength of 10; with kit's config (Max: 15) the same
#                    file is clean, and inverting that (a 16-line method) is
#                    what proves the config is actually being read.
#
#     eslint         `--config=<path>`, but ONLY because kit is checked out
#                    INSIDE the service tree. Measured: with the config beside
#                    the repo, node cannot resolve `@eslint/js` and the run
#                    dies with ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND — which is a red build, not
#                    a lint. Node resolves an ESM import from the CONFIG
#                    FILE's own directory upward, so the config has to sit
#                    under the repo that has the packages.
#
#     yamllint       `-c <path>`, and it needs nothing else. This is the one
#                    that behaves the way everyone assumes all of them do.
#
# WHAT IT IS NOT
#   This does not lint kit. It lints FIXTURES, so it needs no toolchain beyond
#   the three it names, and a missing one is a loud SKIP rather than a pass.
#   Whether kit's own tree is clean under kit's own configs is a separate
#   question, answered separately.
#
# SKIPS ARE REPORTED AND COUNTED, and a skip in a lint proof is a gap: the
# whole point of the phase is that a linter which never ran cannot be claimed
# to work. `validate.sh` counts them in its summary like every other check, and
# this script exits nonzero if any toolchain is missing, because a proof that
# silently did not run is the failure mode this packet exists to remove.
