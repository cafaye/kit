"""Report how far each vendored copy of `core` has fallen behind.

    staleness.py --repos-dir ../ --manifest core/fleet.yml
    staleness.py --repos-dir ../ --repo muse --repo caf
    staleness.py --repos-dir ../ --github-org cafaye

WHAT IT IS FOR

  Every consuming repository records which commit of `core` it vendored. That
  record is a claim, and a claim nobody checks is a rumour — the same argument
  `cafaye-ts/specs/index.json` already makes in its own `about` field. This
  script reads those records, resolves where `core`'s default branch is *now*,
  and prints the distance between the two.

  It exists because the fleet's staleness is otherwise visible only as a red
  build in whichever repository happened to be built, which is the reporting
  half of a problem that needs the fixing half. vendir + Renovate is the fixing
  half (see `core/README.md`); this is how you see the backlog before a PR
  exists to fix it.

THE HARD PART, STATED HONESTLY

  Not the comparison — a sha and a sha is a subtraction. The hard part is
  *discovery*: knowing which repositories consume core, and where each one
  records its pin. Three sources, in the order they are tried:

    1. `--repos-dir`  — every immediate subdirectory that looks like a checkout.
       Works offline, works with a partial clone, and is what you use in a test.
    2. `--repo`       — named repositories, resolved under `--repos-dir`.
    3. `--github-org` — enumerate an organisation through the GitHub API.

  A repository that records its pin in a form this script does not recognise is
  reported as `unknown`, never as `current`. That distinction is the whole
  difference between this being a staleness report and this being a report that
  says everything is fine.

THE PIN, AND WHY THE OLD ONE STILL MATTERS

  A repository can record its core pin two ways, and during the migration it is
  usually both at once:

    * `vendir.lock.yml` — a resolved `sha` under a git content entry. This is
      what vendir writes and what Renovate updates.
    * a `CORE_REF` in `.github/workflows/*.yml` — a full sha in an env block.
      This is the hand-bumped form, and it is still what three repositories use
      today. A migration that only learned to read lockfiles would report all
      three as `unknown` on the day it landed, which is the worst possible moment
      to stop being able to see them.

EXIT STATUS

  0  the table was produced
  1  a repository named on the command line could not be read, or a
     --fail-on-* flag fired
  2  bad invocation

  Deliberately NOT non-zero for "something is stale". A scheduled report that
  exits 1 every week is a scheduled report that gets muted, and the whole reason
  this is an artifact rather than a blocking check is that a stale copy is
  legal — it is a copy that has not been bumped yet. What must be loud is
  *unreadable*, because an unreadable pin is a pin nobody is maintaining.

THE TEMPLATES SCOPE, AND WHY IT NEEDED A NEW WORD

  `--scope core` (the default) measures a PIN. `--scope templates` measures a
  FILE, and a file has a state a pin does not have: **it is not there**.

  Run it:

      staleness.py --repos-dir .. --scope templates
      staleness.py --repos-dir .. --scope templates --repo billing
      staleness.py --repos-dir .. --scope templates --json --fail-on-unpinned

  `--fail-on-unpinned` is off by default for the same reason `--fail-on-behind`
  is: a finding nobody has triaged is a backlog, not a defect, and a report
  that is red every week is a report that gets muted. The TABLE always prints
  every finding and the count either way; the flag only decides the exit
  status, which is what makes it usable in a pull request that adopts
  something and useless as a scheduled job.

  Measured on this fleet at `41f8bcb` (nine services, twelve artefacts):
  **9 cells current, 43 diverged, 32 absent, 5 unknown, 19 n/a** — and
  `templates/parity-allowlist` carries all 80 findings, so
  `--fail-on-unpinned` exits 0. The full breakdown is in `README.md`; the
  number that matters most is that **nine of 108 cells are byte-identical to
  kit**, and eight of those nine are the same artefact: the workflow call.

  Adoption happens by copy, so the question "has this drifted?" assumes a copy
  to compare. In the fleet that assumption is false. Measured on
  2026-09-30, of nine services: zero hold `otel-collector.yml`, one holds
  `bin/dev`, and six `docker-compose.yml` files differ from kit's by more than
  four hundred lines each. Those are not drifted copies. They have been
  replaced, and a reporter that only knew `current` and `stale` would have
  nothing to say about any of them — which is the failure this scope exists to
  name.

  So the templates scope reports FOUR states, and the third is the point:

    current   byte-identical to what kit ships, at the declared path
    diverged  present at the declared path, and not byte-identical
    absent    kit ships one and the service holds NOTHING there
    unknown   it could not be measured (see below)
    n/a       this artefact does not apply to this service at all

  `absent` is not a failure by itself and is not silence either. It is a
  finding with a number attached, and the number is printed on every run: an
  absence nobody counts is an absence nobody migrates.

  `n/a` is the fifth state and it exists because it is NOT `unknown`. A `go`
  service has no `lint/rubocop.yml` because it is not a Ruby service, and that
  is a settled fact about the service, not something the reporter failed to
  measure. Reporting it as `unknown` would give every service in the fleet three
  permanent findings that nobody can fix and every finding to be noise. It is
  the one state that never needs a pin, because there is nothing to pin: kit
  makes no claim about a rubocop config in a Go repository.

WHAT `unknown` COVERS, AND WHY IT IS NOT A PASS

  The classifier fails closed — a change it cannot place is the strictest tier,
  not the loosest — and this reporter inherits the rule rather than copying it.
  Four things land in `unknown`, and every one of them is a case where the
  cheap answer would be a guess:

    * the service declares no `language`, so an artefact kit ships per
      language cannot be resolved. Guessing one and reporting the comparison
      is reporting a guess as a measurement.
    * the path is a symlink. A symlink to a byte-identical file has the right
      bytes today and is a bet that the target never moves.
    * the path is not a regular file, or cannot be read.
    * kit no longer ships the artefact, so there is nothing to compare against.

  Each is a finding that requires a pin, exactly like `absent`.

NEVER INFER A PIN FROM CONTENT

  A file that LOOKS like kit's is not evidence that it IS kit's, and the
  reporter never grades resemblance. There is no threshold, no percentage, no
  "closest match", and no search for a file that hashes to kit's artefact. A
  copy is `current` when the bytes at the declared path are equal and the path
  is a real file in the service's own tree, and at no other time. One appended
  byte makes it `diverged`, and `diverged` needs a pin.

    The rule is the default one — `diverged`, `absent` and `unknown` all need a
    pin, `current` does not — with ONE exemption, and the exemption is narrower
    than it looks.

    `artifacts.json` has documented an `optional` field since kit-14: "true when
    kit genuinely does not expect universal adoption. Such an artefact is
    reported but does not, by itself, make a service look broken." Nothing
    implemented it, because no artefact in the table used it — a property stated
    in one file and asserted in zero places, which is the exact shape this
    repository's own rules call out. kit-21 added the first `optional`
    artefacts (the per-language connection contract) and the reporter turned
    every one of them into an unpinned finding for every service in the fleet,
    which is the opposite of what the field says.

    It exempts `absent` and ONLY `absent`, and the narrowness is the point:

      * `diverged` — the service HAS the artefact and it is not kit's bytes. A
        field about adoption expectation says nothing about a copy that has
        drifted, and that is the state this whole mechanism exists to catch.
      * `unknown` — the reporter could not measure it. `unknown` inherits the
        fail-closed rule above rather than copying it: an unmeasured optional
        artefact is still an unmeasured one.

    So an optional artefact is reported in the table and contributes no finding.
