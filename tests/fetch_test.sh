#
# kit's proof that `bin/dev` can FETCH the stack it runs.
#
#   bash tests/fetch_test.sh
#
# WHY THIS IS A SCRIPT AND NOT A SECTION OF validate.sh
#   The claim is about a *git fetch succeeding*, a *branch being refused*, and
#   an *offline run not touching the network*. None of that is a static property
#   of a file, and all of it is a property of a real subprocess talking to a
#   real remote. So it is executed, the same way `classify_test.sh` and
#   `staleness_test.sh` are, and for the same reason: a check that only parsed
#   `bin/dev` would pass on a script that fetches nothing.
#
# THE REMOTE IS LOCAL
#   Every case here builds a bare repository from kit's own tree and fetches
#   over `file://`. That is not a shortcut around the mechanism — `git fetch
#   --depth 1 <remote> <ref>` is the same command either way, and the ref
#   resolution, the shallow checkout, the cache and the offline refusal are all
#   exercised for real. What it buys is that the suite needs no network, so a
#   CI runner and a laptop on a train get the same answer, and a flaky network
#   can never be mistaken for a broken gate.
#
#   The network path itself (https://github.com/cafaye/kit) is NOT proven here
#   and the report says so: it is one `git ls-remote` away from being, but a
#   gate that depends on github.com is a gate that goes red when github is down.
#
# THE SIX CLAIMS
#   1. A PINNED ref (a 40-hex commit, or a `v<semver>` tag) fetches, and the
#      resolved tree is byte-identical to the checkout it was fetched from.
#   2. A MOVING ref (`master`, a branch name, an empty value, a short sha) is
#      REFUSED — loudly, before any network call, naming what was wrong. This is
#      the "a moving reference is a gate that changes under you" rule, and the
#      refusal has to happen before `git fetch`, because by the time fetch has
#      run the gate has already changed under you.
#   3. OFFLINE (`KIT_STACK_OFFLINE=1`) with the cache warm runs, and says it came
#      from the cache rather than from the network.
#   4. OFFLINE with a cold cache and no remote FAILS LOUDLY and names the one
#      thing that fixes it. It does not silently fall back to whatever is in the
#      working directory, because "the stack that came up" being a different
#      stack than the one you pinned is the whole failure.
#   5. A VENDORED copy (`.kit/stack`) that DECLARES the pinned ref is accepted
#      offline — that is the documented offline story, and it has to work or
#      "use a vendored copy" is a sentence in a README rather than a mode.
#   6. A vendored copy at a DIFFERENT ref is REFUSED. This is the drift the
#      packet exists to remove, in the shape it takes when the copy is vendored
#      instead of fetched: a directory that looks like a stack and is somewhere
#      else. Accepting it silently is how an offline loop stops matching what
#      the team runs.
#
# NO SLEEPS. Every wait is a poll with a deadline, and the only thing polled for
# is this script's own subprocesses.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Built from the REAL tree rather than from a hand-written stub, so the test
# proves the thing ships: a fetched ref has to contain `templates/compose/`
# with the vendor config trees in it, because that is what `bin/dev` then runs.
# A stub with three empty files would pass and prove nothing about the real
# artifact.
REMOTE="$WORK/kit-remote.git"
# Built from the WORKING TREE, not from HEAD. A `git clone --bare "$ROOT"` of a
# tree with uncommitted changes produces a remote holding the last COMMIT, so
# every "the fetched bytes are the shipped bytes" assertion below would compare
# this packet's new files against the ones before them and fail for a reason
# that has nothing to do with the mechanism. Three extra lines make the remote
# contain exactly what is on disk, which is the only thing that makes the
# comparison mean anything.

# `tar` over the tree and NOT `git ls-files`, because this has to work in a
# directory that is not a git repository — which is exactly what
# `self_test.sh`'s throwaway copies are. It was `git ls-files`, and the
# consequence was the sharpest failure mode this file could have: the self-test
# CONTROL went red, because a break of nothing at all was reported as a broken
# gate. A control that is red is not a control.
