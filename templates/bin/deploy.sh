#
# WHAT THIS IS, PRECISELY, SO A READER IS NOT MISLED. It runs the full shape of
# a production deployment — immutable artifact, ordered start, real health
# gates, restart policy, credential injection, automatic rollback on a failed
# health gate — against a Docker daemon. The TARGET is whatever daemon you
# point it at. Pointed at this machine's local daemon it is a
# production-shaped deployment that runs LOCALLY. It is not a remote deploy
# and does not become one by being called from a laptop. See
# templates/deploy/README.md, "What this is not".
#
# THE FOUR THINGS THAT ARE ACTUALLY HARD, AND WHERE THEY ARE
#
#   1. CREDENTIALS.  The platform's rule is no plaintext at rest, never in a
#      config file, never logged, and a deploy is the most likely place in the
#      system to break it, because deploy tooling prints its own configuration.
#      Handled by: never accepting a secret as an argument or from a file, and
#      `run_scrubbed` wrapping everything this tool prints. See --secrets-fd.
#
#   2. HEALTH GATES THAT CAN GO RED.  A gate that only ever says yes is
#      decoration. `up` does not report success until the container's own
#      healthcheck reports `healthy`, and if it never does, the deploy rolls
#      itself back and says so. `verify` reports the current verdict and its
#      exit code reflects it.
#
#   3. ROLLBACK.  Not a paragraph about how one might roll back. The previous
#      artifact is recorded before the new one is started, and `rollback`
#      redeploys it and waits for its health gate. Tested, not described.
#
#   4. NOT TOUCHING STATE THAT IS NOT OURS.  Every container, network and
#      volume this tool creates is named by the compose project, which
#      defaults to `kit-deploy-<service>`. It never runs `docker system prune`,
#      never runs `docker volume prune`, and never references a container it
#      did not create by that name. A machine with other people's Docker in it
#      is the normal case, not an edge case.
#
# NO SLEEPS ANYWHERE.  Every wait is a poll on a real signal -- a container
# health status, an HTTP status code -- against a deadline. `sleep` appears
# only as the interval BETWEEN polls, which is how often the tool is allowed to
# ask, not how long it guesses something takes.

  # only correct for as long as the container holding it. Injecting at each
  # service's own start and then trusting that nothing later touches it is a
  # deploy that is correct until an image is re-pulled — which on a machine with
  # a shared image cache is a Tuesday.
