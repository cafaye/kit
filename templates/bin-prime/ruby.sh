#!/usr/bin/env bash
#
# kit template — prime a Ruby worktree. Copy to bin/prime in the service repo
# and run it after `git clone`, `git worktree add`, or `git pull --rebase`.
#
#   bin/prime            # bundle, rubocop, then the full rake suite
#   bin/prime --fast     # bundle only
#
# WHAT IT PROMISES
#   Exit 0: dependencies resolve, the linter is clean, and every test passes.
#   Anything else: nonzero, with the failing step named. `set -euo pipefail` is
#   the whole mechanism — no error handling to forget.
#
# STRICTNESS NOTES
#   - No `mise install` here. mise.toml pins the interpreter; this script only
#     primes dependencies. A missing ruby/bundle exits 127 with instructions
#     instead of installing a toolchain behind your back.
#   - `bundle install` (not `bundle update`): a prime never moves the lockfile.
#     If the lock is stale, the fix is a deliberate commit, not a side effect of
#     opening a worktree.
#   - Rubocop runs before the tests on purpose: a formatting offense should cost
#     you one second, not a full suite run.
