# The tier declaration for Elixir. Copy this file beside your database tests.
#
# THE ADAPTER THIS LANGUAGE NEEDS
#
# ExUnit has no tier-declaration channel. A module attribute is the closest
# thing Elixir has to an exported const, and it is the shape an adapter can read
# without parsing: `@tier :db` is one token, and it is on the module, so
# collecting the tiers is walking the modules a suite already loaded.
#
# The attribute is a no-op at runtime. ExUnit ignores it, no test depends on
# it, and it costs one word at compile time. What it buys is a declaration an
# adapter can read instead of a sentinel a grep can miss — which is the whole
# difference between a tier that is entered by writing it and one that is
# entered by writing the word `Repo.` somewhere near a test.
#
# THE REASON IS ALREADY THERE, FOR FREE
#
# `@tag :db` and `@tag {:skip, "needs a live postgres"}` are ExUnit's own
# vocabulary. So for Elixir the declared reason is a tag, not a new syntax, and
# the adapter is a filter over tags ExUnit already reports.
