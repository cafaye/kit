// The tier declaration for Rust. Copy this file into your crate.
//
// WHY RUST IS THE MODEL, WITH ONE CORRECTION
//
// `#[ignore = "..."]` is a *documented, stable field of the attribute*, and its
// message is carried all the way to the test output. A tier, a reason, and a
// full inventory therefore all come from the standard library, with no parser
// and no kit-written convention to drift from the compiler.
//
// The correction is about the COLLECTOR, and it was measured rather than
// assumed, because the obvious recipe does not work on a stable toolchain:
//
//   cargo test -- --list --format json
//     -> error: The "json" format is only accepted on the nightly compiler
//        with -Z unstable-options
//
// Verified against rustc 1.95.0 (stable). So on stable there is no JSON
// inventory, and the JSON schema this table is usually quoted for is not
// available to the fleet today. The two stable commands below are what
// actually work, and between them they carry everything the JSON would have:
//
//   cargo test -- --list                  # INVENTORY: every test, ignored ones
//                                       #   INCLUDED. 3 tests listed above, all
//                                       #   of them, whether ignored or not.
//   cargo test -- --list --ignored        # the IGNORED subset. 1 test listed.
//   cargo test                            # a RUN prints the reason:
//                                       #   test tests::tier_db_needs_postgres
//                                       #     ... ignored, cafaye:tier=db reason=…
//
// `--list --include-ignored` is a trap and is called out here so nobody builds
// on it: it lists all 3 tests, exactly as `--list` does, so it reads like a
// filter and filters nothing. `--ignored` is the flag that actually filters.
//
// WHAT THE SET DIFF PROVES
//
//   inventory  = cargo test -- --list            (3 tests, ignored included)
//   gated out  = cargo test -- --list --ignored  (1 test)
//   ran        = the run's own list              (2 tests, the other 1 ignored)
//
// An absent test is invisible to JUnit and visible here, because the inventory
// is produced by the same compiler that produced the binary. That asymmetry is
// the whole reason this declaration is the one to copy.
