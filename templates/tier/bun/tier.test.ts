// The tier declaration for Bun. Copy this file beside your database tests.
//
// WHAT IS MEASURED HERE, AND WHAT IS STILL A GAP
//
// `bun test` 1.3.12's JUnit reporter was run against a two-test file to settle
// two claims rather than assume them:
//
//   1. bun DOES emit a full inventory. A test filtered out of the run is still
//      present as a <testcase>:
//        bun test -t "alpha_ran" --reporter=junit --reporter-outfile=r.xml
//          -> 1 pass, 1 filtered out
//          -> <testsuites tests="2" skipped="1">
//               <testcase name="alpha_ran" .../>
//               <testcase name="beta_filtered_out" .../>   <- present, empty body
//
//      So the failure mode this whole convention exists to prevent — an absent
//      <testcase> being indistinguishable from a test that was never written —
//      does NOT occur in bun's reporter. That is better than the general claim
//      about JUnit, and it is worth knowing before writing an adapter for it.
//
//   2. What bun does NOT have is a declared REASON. `test.skip(name, fn)` takes
//      no reason argument, so there is nowhere to put `reason=needs a live
//      postgres` and nowhere for the skip allowlist to read one from.
//
// THE GAP THIS FILE STILL HAS, STATED PLAINLY
//
// The distinction between "declared skip" and "filtered out" is an empty child
// element versus a <skipped/> child. That is observed behaviour on 1.3.12, and
// it is NOT a documented contract — it is the absence of a field, and an
// absence of a field is not a promise. Do not build a gate on it without
// pinning the version, and prefer the normalised format below, which is written
// down rather than inferred.
//
// THE ADAPTER THIS LANGUAGE NEEDS
//
// bun has no tier-declaration channel of its own: nothing in `bun test` reads an
// exported const. `TIER` below is a no-op at runtime that a ~15-line adapter
// reads, which is the whole reason it is exported rather than commented. That
// adapter is `caf gate`'s job, not kit's — see templates/tier/README.md.

 * `tier` field, and the suffix of the gate variable: REQUIRED_DB=1. */
