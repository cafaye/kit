// kit template — the runtime credential-leak canary.
//
// WHAT THIS IS
//
//	No off-the-shelf tool finds a credential that leaks at RUN time. gosec's
//	`credentials.Match` switches on four AST node types and has no
//	`*ast.CallExpr` case, so it finds literals and not a token passed to a
//	logger. Bandit matches `ast.Constant` only. Brakeman's secret check is
//	optional and off. Of 268 Semgrep taint rules, zero intersect CWE-532.
//
//	That is a finding, not a gap in the search, and it is why this file exists.
//	gitleaks answers "was a secret committed". Nothing answers "does a secret
//	leave the process while the tests run".
//
// THE CANARY
//
//	A fake credential that is unmistakably fake AND unmistakably a credential:
//	the `cafaye_canary_` prefix, then 32 bytes. Planted in the service's own
//	configuration, run through the whole suite, and then swept for in every
//	place it could have gone.
//
//	It is BUILT, not written out, and that is a security property rather than a
//	style one. A committed 46-character `cafaye_canary_…` literal is, to every
//	scanner in the world, a high-entropy string with a credential-ish prefix —
//	it is exactly the thing this repository's own gitleaks job is built to
//	report, and adding one to an allowlist to make it go away would be the
//	exact failure the allowlist's reason-per-entry rule exists to prevent. So
//	the value is assembled at run time, the full string never appears in any
//	committed file, and `.gitleaks.toml` needs no entry for it. `TestCanaryIsSafe`
//	asserts the absence directly, and the tree-wide gitleaks scan being green
//	is the second half of the proof.
//
// THE CONTRACT
//
//	Language-neutral, in ../README.md. This file is the Go adapter. The five
//	vectors are:
//
//	  1  canary            the string appears in no log, stdout or stderr
//	  2  unknown-field     serialise it; no unrecognised key carries the value
//	  3  stringified-error %v / %+v / Sprint over the whole error chain
//	  4  absent-field      no credential-named key is marshalled at all, even
//	                       empty — the absence is a signal too
//	  5  type-coverage     no credential-bearing type is printable or an error
//	                       (typecover.go, and it is a TYPE check, not a call
//	                       graph — read its LIMITATION note)
//
// NO DEPENDENCIES. Stdlib only, so the harness runs with GOPROXY=off.
