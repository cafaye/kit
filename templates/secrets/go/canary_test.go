// kit template — the canary vectors, executed.
//
// WHAT THIS SUITE IS NOT
//
//	It is not a demonstration that the detectors work. Every vector below runs
//	TWICE: once against `internal/safe`, which must come back clean, and once
//	against `internal/leaky`, which must come back RED. The second run is the
//	red proof, and it is in the same test as the first so that a detector
//	cannot be deleted from one half of the story.
//
//	That is the difference between a check and a report, and it is the whole
//	reason the leaky package exists. A detector that stopped working would
//	otherwise be indistinguishable from a codebase that stopped leaking, and
//	the second is not a thing anyone is working on.
//
//	Each RED PROOF line is printed with t.Log, so it appears in the output of
//	`go test -v` and in kit's own gate. A proof nobody can see is a proof
//	nobody ran.
//
// VECTORS
