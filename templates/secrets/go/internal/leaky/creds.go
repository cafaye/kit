// Package leaky is a DELIBERATELY DEFECTIVE credential-bearing package.
//
//	DO NOT COPY ANYTHING IN HERE INTO A SERVICE.
//
// It exists for one reason: the harness's detectors have to be shown failing, or
// they are assertions about a counter-example nobody can see. Every type below
// carries exactly one of the five defects the canary contract names, so a
// detector that stops working shows up as a red vector rather than as a green
// build that has quietly stopped testing anything.
//
// It lives under `internal/`, so Go's own import rules make it unreachable
// from outside this module. A service that copies the template gets a package it
// cannot import and whose name says why it is there.
//
// WHAT IS WRONG WITH EACH TYPE
//
//	Session              vector 1 + 2 — an exported Token field with no
//	                     `json:"-"`, so it reaches a log line under `%+v` and
//	                     reaches the wire under `json.Marshal`.
//	MintedSession        vector 4 — marshals a `token` key even when the token
//	                     is empty, which teaches every consumer to look for a
//	                     key that is always there.
//	AuthError            vector 3 — `Error()` interpolates the credential, and
//	                     the wrapping error delegates to it, so formatting the
//	                     OUTER error is enough to print the secret.
//	PrintableSession     vector 5 — a `String()` method on a credential-bearing
//	                     type, which is what the type-coverage analyzer exists
//	                     to refuse.
