// kit template — the measurement the reference package's shape rests on.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS SEPARATELY FROM canary_test.go
//
//	`internal/safe`'s design is a truth table about `fmt`, and that table is a
//	property of the standard library rather than of this code. If a future Go
//	release changes it — and the results below are exactly the kind of thing a
//	formatting change could quietly alter — then every type shaped like
//	`internal/safe.Session` becomes a credential in every log line, and nothing
//	else in the suite would notice. Vector 1 only exercises the shapes kit
//	already got right, so it would keep passing while the reference pattern
//	rotted underneath it.
//
//	So the measurement itself is asserted, in full, and the expected verdicts are
//	written out rather than derived. A test that recomputed the table from the
//	same rules the code uses would prove that the code agrees with itself.
//
// WHAT THE TABLE SHOWS
//
//	shape                        %v %+v %#v %s  %q  %d  %x  %X  %t  %e  %U
//	value field,   unexported    ✗   ✗   ✗   ✗   ✗   ✗   ✗   ✗   ✗   ✗   ✗

//	func field,    unexported    ·   ·   ·   ·   ·   ·   ·   ·   ·   ·   ·
//
//	· = the credential is absent.   ✗ = it is printed.
//
//	FOUR FINDINGS, AND THE FIRST THREE ARE THE ONES PEOPLE GET WRONG
//
//	1. AN UNEXPORTED FIELD IS NOT PROTECTION. `fmt` reaches unexported fields
//	   through reflection and prints their values. The field being lowercase buys
//	   nothing against `%v`, and `%v` is in every log line in every service.
//	   `-race` will not stop it and `go vet` will not mention it.
//
//	2. A `String()` METHOD ON THE FIELD'S TYPE IS IGNORED WHEN THE FIELD IS
//	   UNEXPORTED. `fmt` cannot call a method on a value obtained from an
//	   unexported field, so it falls back to reflection and prints the struct. A
//	   redacting `String()` is real protection in an EXPORTED field and worth
//	   nothing in an unexported one. This is the one that surprises people,
//	   because the redaction is right there in the code.
//
//	3. THE POINTER SHAPE IS NOT A FREE LUNCH. An unexported pointer field prints
//	   an address under `%v`, which looks like the answer, and then `%s` and `%q`
//	   walk the pointer and print the value anyway. A shape that is safe under the
//	   verb everyone uses and unsafe under two others is worse than one that is
//	   obviously broken, because it passes review.
//
//	4. THE HEX VERBS ARE A LEAK TOO, AND NOT AN OBVIOUS ONE. `%x` and `%X` print
//	   the credential as `6361666179655f…`. That is not a log line a human can
//	   read, and it is a perfectly reversible encoding of a live secret, and
//	   `xxd -r -p` is one command away. A table that called `%x` safe would be
//	   wrong in the way that matters, which is why the predicate in
//	   TestFmtTruthTable asks about both hex cases and not about the literal
//	   bytes. This was found by writing the table down, not by reading fmt's
//	   source, which is the argument for writing tables down.
//
//	AND ONE RESULT THAT IS THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT FINDING 2 PREDICTS
//
//	Finding 2 says fmt cannot dispatch to String() on a value taken from an
//	unexported field, and the unexported POINTER row bears that out for `%s` and
//	`%q`. But `%d` on that same field prints the pointer ADDRESS and is safe — so
//	an unexported pointer field is safe under `%d` and unsafe under `%s`, which is
//	not a rule anyone would have guessed and is why the table is written out
//	instead of derived.
//
//	AND THE ONE SHAPE THAT IS SAFE UNDER EVERY VERB
//
//	A `func() string` field. `fmt` can only ever reach the pointer to the closure.
//	It has a second property worth as much as the first: `encoding/json` REFUSES
//	to marshal a struct with a func field, so a type shaped that way cannot be
//	serialised with the credential in it even by accident. It is awkward to use
//	for a credential read several times per request, which is why
//	`internal/safe` demonstrates the pointer shape as its primary holder.
//
//	AND THE REAL ANSWER, WHICH IS ABOVE ALL OF THEM
//
//	Don't hold the credential. Pass the `*Token` to the code that authenticates
//	with it, and keep only the subject and the scopes in a struct that gets
//	logged. `internal/safe.Claims` is that shape, and it is the one kit points a
//	service at first.
