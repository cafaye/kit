# AGENTS.md — <service-name>

## What this service is

- **Name:** `<service-name>`
- **Language / toolchain:** `<go | ruby | elixir | python | node | rust>` — pinned in `mise.toml`
- **Owns:** `<the one responsibility, in one sentence>`
- **Does not own:** `<the neighbouring services it must not grow into>`
- **Upstream specs:** `core`'s `cafaye.yml` manifest, OpenAPI, and event
  schemas. The spec is the source of truth; the code follows it, never the
  reverse.

## Commands

Run these; do not improvise equivalents.

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Prime the worktree | `bin/prime` |
| Prime without tests | `bin/prime --fast` |
| Run tests | `<the suite command>` |
| Run the linter | `<the lint command>` |
| Coverage gate | `<the coverage command>` |
| Everything CI runs | `bin/prime` — CI runs the same steps in the same order |

## Conventions

- **Never** edit a lockfile as a side effect (`go.sum`, `Gemfile.lock`,
  `mix.lock`, `uv.lock`, `package-lock.json`, `Cargo.lock`). A lockfile change
  is its own commit with its own reason.
- **Never** weaken a linter, add an inline disable, or raise a threshold to
  make a build green. Fix the code, or open a PR that says why the rule is
  wrong.
- **Never** copy code from `moon/refs/` into this repo. Those trees are
  behavioral references only; every line here is written from scratch.
- Errors are wrapped at the boundary (`errorlint`, `Error` structs) and carry
  the identifier needed to find the failing row, not just a message.
- Money is integer minor units. Time is UTC. IDs are opaque strings.

## The local stack

**You do not copy kit's stack.** There is no `docker-compose.yml` of kit's in this
repository, no `otel-collector.yml`, and no `tempo/`, `loki/` or
`grafana/`. `bin/dev` fetches all of it from a **pinned** ref and runs it beside
your own `docker-compose.yml`, which is an **override** — the second `-f`, so what
is in it wins and everything you did not mention still comes from kit.

- **`kit.ref`, one committed line at the repository root, is the pin.** A
  40-character commit sha, or a `v<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<PATCH>` tag. **Never a branch**,
  and never a variable in `.env`: `.env` is git-ignored, so a pin there exists on
  one machine and on no CI runner. `bin/dev` refuses a branch loudly, before any
  network call. `bin/dev pin <ref>` moves it deliberately and prints the stack diff
  first.
- **Your `docker-compose.yml` may** set `image:`, add keys to **your own
  service's** `environment:`, add a `depends_on`, declare your own services, and
  change a published port **by changing the variable in `.env`**.
- **Your `docker-compose.yml` may not** touch `otel-collector` — not its `image:`,
  not its `command:`, and above all not the `volumes:` entry that mounts
  `otel-collector.yml`. That file carries the redaction allowlist, and it is
  **derived from core's schemas**; owning it means shipping a telemetry boundary
  nobody derived, and prompt content leaves the process inside it. Nor may you
  override the three AGPL backends, set `allow_all_keys`, or add an exporter.
- **A `ports:` entry for a service kit ships is a bug, and a quiet one.** Compose
  **appends** a second file's `ports:` list rather than replacing it, so writing
  one publishes postgres on kit's port *and* on yours. Move the port in `.env`.
  This is measured, not folklore, and kit's gate fails on it.
- **Your account boundary is Postgres, not your `WHERE` clauses.** If this service
  holds rows belonging to a customer, `templates/database/tenancy/` applies:
  `cafaye.protect_table('<table>')` in each account-scoped table's migration,
  `cafaye.begin_account/1` once per request inside your transaction, and the
  application connecting as **`<service>_app`** rather than `<service>`. The
  `<service>_app` role is provisioned for you and owns nothing, which is what
  stops it turning its own policies off.
- **`FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` is not optional and nothing will remind you.** It
  is applied by `protect_table`, and without it the role your migrations run as
  reads every account's rows while the policies read as if they were in place.
  **Keep your `where account_id = ?`** — it is what makes the query indexable and
  what `core`'s `tenancy.yml` requires. RLS is the second line, not the first.
- **`templates/database/<lang>/tenancy_test.*` must run in your gate.** Copy it
  beside `isolation.sql` and `assertions.txt` and demand the tier with
  `REQUIRED_DB=1`. That turns a missing `TEST_DATABASE_URL` into a **failure**
  rather than a skip, because a skip here is a green run that proved nothing.
- **Your database is a `.env` line, not a compose override.** Add your service's
  name to `KIT_POSTGRES_DATABASES`, comma-separated. The init script gives you a
  `NOSUPERUSER` role and a database you own, and closes every other service's
  database to you.
- **`POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_DB` and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` may not be set on
  `services.postgres` — and this used to be kit's own advice, which is how one
  fleet service ended up holding a cluster superuser role.** Measured against
  the real cluster: the image creates `POSTGRES_USER` as a **superuser**, so the
  override lets your service read every other service's database; and because the
  image has already created that role and that database, `CREATE ROLE` and
  `CREATE DATABASE` in the init script then fail **during initdb** and the whole
  cluster refuses to start. `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` breaks neither — it is refused
  because one service's file would decide the credential every other service on
  the cluster authenticates with. For the cluster's own identity the variables
  are `KIT_POSTGRES_USER` / `KIT_POSTGRES_DB` / `KIT_POSTGRES_PASSWORD`. kit's
  gate fails on the three `POSTGRES_*` spellings.

## Observability

Telemetry is on by default. The **stores to read it back from are not** — that
is `KIT_DEV_PROFILES=observability bin/dev up`, and `bin/dev up` on its own gives
you postgres/nats/redis plus the collector. The collector is not behind the
profile, so a service with nothing configured still exports into it, and the
redaction allowlist still runs before anything would be stored.

- **`<SERVICE>_OTEL_ENDPOINT` is the only contract** — `MUSE_OTEL_ENDPOINT`,
  `CAF_OTEL_ENDPOINT`, `DARKSROOM_OTEL_ENDPOINT`, whatever this service is
  called, uppercase, no `OTEL_EXPORTER_` prefix and no `_EXPORTER_` infix. Its
  DEFAULT is the collector that ships with `bin/dev`, which is why a developer
  still gets real spans with nothing configured.
- **A self-hoster who already runs Datadog, Honeycomb or Grafana Cloud sets that
  variable** and the shipped stack goes quiet for this service. Bring-your-own
  is a supported deployment, documented as carefully as the default, not a
  degraded mode.
- **Turning telemetry off is one variable.** Unset it and the exporter is a
  genuine no-op: no queue, no retry loop against a dead endpoint, no warning per
  request, no dial at boot. Implement that with `OTEL_SDK_DISABLED` — the
  OpenTelemetry spec's own switch — rather than a cafaye reimplementation, and
  check `OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER`, `OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER` and
  `OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER` too. A no-op that only covers traces still phones home
  for metrics, and that is the failure a customer's invoice finds first.
- **Telemetry is NEVER in a readiness path.** Not in `/healthz`, not in
  `/readyz`, not in a `depends_on`, not in a compose healthcheck. A service that
  waits for the collector serves no traffic while the collector is down, which
  is strictly worse than serving traffic with no traces. `kit`'s
  `tests/no_telemetry_in_readiness.sh` proves this against a real collector;
  a service that breaks it will not be caught there, so it is written down here.
- **`error.type` is a bounded class, never a message.** snake_case, 64
  characters, from the fleet vocabulary. `error.message` and
  `error.stacktrace` are prohibited by name: a provider's content-policy
  rejection quotes the offending content back at you, so the message is a
  prompt by another route. The predicate for "this is an error" is span STATUS,
  not `error.type`.
- **Exceptions are LOG RECORDS.** The `exception` span event is deprecated; an
  exception log record with a severity chosen by expected impact replaces it.
- **The collector enforces the redaction allowlist** (core's
  `redaction.schema.json`, `enforcedAt: collector`). The per-service SDK
  allowlist is defence in depth, not the only line — and a service pointing
  `*_OTEL_ENDPOINT` at a vendor backend is exactly the case where the collector
  is the only line.

## Testing

- Tests are written **first**, and shown failing before the implementation.
- No sleeps, no raised retries, no loosened assertions. A flaky test is
  attributed before it is fixed: failing test → can this diff reach that
  surface → measure the baseline at a clean HEAD.
- Coverage is gated in CI (see `COVERAGE_FAIL_UNDER` in the CI caller). Raising
  the gate is allowed; lowering it is not.

## Contracts

- Every endpoint and event this service exposes or consumes is generated from
  `core`'s specs and validated in CI. Never hand-write a response shape.
- Breaking a contract is a major version plus a migration note in `README.md`
  and `CHANGELOG.md`, reviewed by a human — not a patch.
