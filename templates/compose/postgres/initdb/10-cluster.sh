# One Postgres CLUSTER. One DATABASE per service. One ROLE per service.
#
# This is the whole of kit's isolation contract, and database-per-service is
# why the cluster is shared rather than one-per-service: the DATABASE is the
# boundary. Two services that each own a database cannot read each other's
# rows, because `REVOKE ALL ON DATABASE ... FROM PUBLIC` below means role
# `courier` is refused at the door of database `billing` before a single query is
# parsed.
#
# WHY A ROLE PER SERVICE AND NOT A SHARED ROLE. A shared role can CONNECT to
# every database in the cluster, so "cannot read another service's data" becomes
# a GRANT somebody has to remember to withhold. One role per service makes the
# refusal structural: there is no second credential to leak and no grant to get
# right, because the ONLY role holding CONNECT on `billing` is `billing`.
#
# WHY THE REVOKE IS HERE AND NOT LEFT TO THE OPERATOR. Postgres grants CONNECT
# on every database to PUBLIC by default, including ones created after this
# script runs. A cluster provisioned without these lines therefore has, by
# default, NO isolation: every role in the fleet can open every database. It
# fails open and silently, and the symptom is a cross-service query that works
# in development and is a report in production.
#
# It is also per-database and per-run. An operator who adds a database by hand
# gets Postgres's default rather than this contract, which is why
# `templates/bin/dev.sh`'s `db grant` prints the exact statements for one new
# database instead of assuming they happened.
#
# WHAT IS NOT HERE. Credentials are not. Every role below takes
# `$POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, because this runs on a developer's machine and a shared
# development password is the point. Isolation is by PRIVILEGE and never by
# secret, which is exactly why the proof in `tests/isolation_test.sh` can
# demonstrate the boundary while knowing every password in the cluster. In
# production the roles carry distinct passwords from the deployment secret
# store, and nothing about the boundary below changes.

# The C locale, for this script only, and it is load-bearing rather than
# hygienic.
#
# Shell bracket ranges — `[a-z]`, `[!a-z0-9_]` — are COLLATION-DEPENDENT, and
# `require_identifier` below is built entirely out of them. Under `en_US.UTF-8`,
# which is the default on the machine this fleet is developed on, collation is
# case-insensitive at the primary level, so `[a-z]` matches `B` and `[!a-z]` does
# NOT match it. Measured, same pattern, two locales:
#
#   $ LC_ALL=C          bash -c 'case Billing in [!a-z_]*) echo REFUSE;; *) echo ACCEPT;; esac'
#   REFUSE
#   $ LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 bash -c '…'
#   ACCEPT
#
# So on a developer Mac the identifier rule was enforcing roughly half of what
# its own message claims. `Billing`, `BILLING` and `cafayé` were all accepted
# while the error string said `must match [a-z_][a-z0-9_]*`.
#
# That is not injection — the characters that would break out of an unquoted
# identifier (quotes, semicolons) still sort outside `[a-z]` and are still
# refused under either locale. It is worse than that, quietly: Postgres folds
# unquoted identifiers to lower case, so `KIT_POSTGRES_DATABASES=Billing` and
# `…=billing` name the SAME database. Two services differing only in case would
# share one database and one role — which is precisely the harm
# `require_identifier`'s own message says it exists to prevent, arriving by the
# one route that produces a legal-looking name.
#
# `LC_ALL=C` is set rather than the pattern being rewritten with `[[:lower:]]`
# because the locale also governs `tr`, `sort` and `printf %q` further down, and
# a provisioning script that compares strings differently depending on whose
# laptop ran it is not deterministic in any sense that matters. Exported, so the
# `psql` calls inherit it too.

# THE CONTRACT, ENFORCED OVER EVERY DATABASE RATHER THAN A LIST OF THEM.
#
# This block replaces a list, and the reason is that the list was not the whole
# truth. The official image creates TWO databases before any init script is
# sourced — the one named by `POSTGRES_DB`, and a stock `postgres` maintenance
# database that nothing here had touched. So the cluster came up with
# `has_database_privilege('public','postgres','CONNECT') = true` while this
# script printed "PUBLIC holds CONNECT on none of them". A closing sentence that
# is wrong is worse than no closing sentence, because it is the one a reader
# trusts.
#
# Sweeping every non-template database makes the invariant hold BY CONSTRUCTION
# rather than by a list somebody has to remember to extend, and `postgres` is
# covered because it is a database rather than because it was named.
#
# A DO block rather than a shell loop because this needs `pg_database`, which a
# REVOKE cannot be made conditional against from bash without a separate
# existence test per database — and the per-database existence test is exactly
# where this went wrong first: psql does NOT interpolate `:'vars'` in a
# `--command` string (measured: "syntax error at or near \":\""), so the test
# failed, and because it sat inside an `if [ -n "$(…)" ]` its failure was
# SWALLOWED. The script then carried on, skipped the revoke, and exited 0
# reporting a boundary it had not applied. `set -e` does not reach inside a
# command substitution used as an `if` condition; only an explicit check does.
#
# Which is the general shape of the lesson rather than a detail of this line: a
# load-bearing statement whose failure is ignored is how a cluster comes up
# holding three of nine databases and reports itself healthy. Hence one call,
# no `if`, and `ON_ERROR_STOP` doing the work.
#
# ...and the body below carries NO COMMENTS AT ALL, which is the third way this
# same block went wrong and the reason for the rule rather than the fix:
#
#   - a `#` line is not a SQL comment. Inside a DO block it is a syntax error
#     ("syntax error at or near …").
#   - the dollar-quote TAG appears inside the body. Writing that tag in a
#     comment inside a dollar-quoted block ENDS the block at that point
#     ("syntax error at or near \"span\""), because a dollar-quoted string is
#     closed by its own tag wherever that appears — comments do not shield it.
#   - psql does not interpolate `:'vars'` inside a dollar-quoted body, so the
#     admin role cannot be passed in that way either ("syntax error at or near
#     \":\""). Hence `current_user`, which is that role already.
#
# All three failed loudly, which is the behaviour this block is supposed to
# have: the cluster refused to start rather than coming up without a boundary.
# The earlier version of this block did the opposite — see above. Explanation
# lives in this comment, where it cannot be parsed.
