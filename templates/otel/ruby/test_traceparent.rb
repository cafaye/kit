# kit template — W3C Trace Context propagation for a Rails service.
#
# Copy traceparent.rb and this file into your service, then run
# `ruby -Itest test/test_traceparent.rb` (or let `rake test` pick it up). The
# suite is the contract: it proves the template still continues a trace instead
# of quietly restarting it.
#
# REFERENCE: W3C Trace Context, W3C Recommendation 23 November 2021
# https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/ — every rule asserted below cites the
# section that requires it.
#
# WHAT IT PROMISES
#   - A valid inbound traceparent is continued: same trace-id, sampled flag
#     preserved, parent-id replaced with this hop's span id (§3.4).
#   - A missing or malformed traceparent starts a new trace and never raises.
#     A request is not a 500 because its trace header was garbage.
#   - tracestate travels with the trace, capped at 512 characters and truncated
#     on whole-entry boundaries (§3.3.1.5).
