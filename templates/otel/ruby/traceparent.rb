# kit template — W3C Trace Context propagation for a Rails service.
#
# Copy traceparent.rb and test_traceparent.rb into your service. For inbound
# requests, rack_middleware.rb.snippet wires this into a Rails controller
# around_action; keep the test suite either way.
#
# The upstream OTel SDK does this for you — see rack_middleware.rb.snippet for
# the versioned wiring. Use this file when you need the header handling on its
# own: a webhook signer, a Sidekiq job that talks to another service, or a test
# that asserts propagation without standing up an SDK.
#
# REFERENCE: W3C Trace Context, W3C Recommendation 23 November 2021
# https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/
#
# IMPLEMENTED SECTIONS (every one is asserted in test_traceparent.rb)
#   3.2.1     header name: accept any case, send lowercase
#   3.2.2.1   version is 2 hex chars; ff is forbidden
#   3.2.2.2   version-format for version 00
#   3.2.2.3   invalid trace-id -> ignore the traceparent (all zeroes forbidden)
#   3.2.2.4   invalid parent-id -> ignore the traceparent (all zeroes forbidden)
#   3.2.2.5   trace-flags is a bit field; mask on read
#   3.2.2.5.1 the sampled flag is the only flag in version 00
#   3.2.2.5.2 reserved flags MUST be set to zero on the wire
#   3.2.4     higher version: parse positionally, re-emit at 00, drop unknowns
#   3.3       a failed traceparent MUST NOT be rescued by a tracestate
#   3.3.1.5   tracestate: propagate >=512 chars, truncate whole entries only
#   4.2/4.3   no traceparent -> new trace; invalid -> restart, never an error
#
# NO DEPENDENCIES. Stdlib only, so this file drops into any Rails service and
# the test suite runs without `bundle install`.

# not an error because its trace header was garbage (3.2.2.3, 4.2).

# See the file header for the W3C Trace Context sections behind each rule, and
# `test_traceparent.rb` for the suite that asserts them.
