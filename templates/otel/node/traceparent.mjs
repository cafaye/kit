// kit template — W3C Trace Context propagation for a Hono/TypeScript service.
//
// Copy traceparent.mjs and traceparent.test.mjs into your service. For inbound
// requests, hono.ts.snippet wires this into middleware; keep the test suite
// either way.
//
// The upstream OTel SDK does this for you — see hono.ts.snippet for the
// versioned wiring. Use this file when you need the header handling on its own:
// a queue consumer, a webhook signer, or a test that asserts propagation without
// standing up an SDK.

// IMPLEMENTED SECTIONS (every one is asserted in traceparent.test.mjs)
//   §3.2.1     header name: accept any case, send lowercase
//   §3.2.2.1   version is 2 hex chars; ff is forbidden
//   §3.2.2.2   version-format for version 00
//   §3.2.2.3   invalid trace-id -> ignore the traceparent (all zeroes forbidden)
//   §3.2.2.4   invalid parent-id -> ignore the traceparent (all zeroes forbidden)
//   §3.2.2.5   trace-flags is a bit field; mask on read
//   §3.2.2.5.1 the sampled flag is the only flag in version 00
//   §3.2.2.5.2 reserved flags MUST be set to zero on the wire
//   §3.2.4     higher version: parse positionally, re-emit at 00, drop unknowns
//   §3.3       a failed traceparent MUST NOT be rescued by a tracestate
//   §3.3.1.5   tracestate: propagate >=512 chars, truncate whole entries only
//   §4.2/§4.3  no traceparent -> new trace; invalid -> restart, never an error
//
// NO DEPENDENCIES. node:crypto, full stop — so this drops into any Hono service
// and the suite runs without `npm install`. Import it from TypeScript directly;
// there is nothing here that needs a build step.
