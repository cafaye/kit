# W3C traceparent — Python (FastAPI)

FastAPI's trace propagation, so a request that enters one cafaye service and
leaves it another still reads as **one** trace in a trace view rather than two
unrelated ones.

## Which of the two files do I use

| File | Use it when |
|------|-------------|
| `traceparent.py` | You need the header handling **on its own**: a queue consumer with no HTTP server, a webhook signer, a background task, or a test that asserts propagation without standing up an SDK. Stdlib only, no dependencies. |
| [`fastapi.py.snippet`](./fastapi.py.snippet) | You are serving FastAPI's requests. The upstream OpenTelemetry SDK already implements all of this and also gives you spans, metrics and a trace UI. Versions are in [../pins.md](../pins.md); kit vendors nothing. |

The snippet is the right answer for a new service. The codec exists for the
cases the SDK does not reach, and for a service that does not want an exporter
at all.

**Keep the suite either way.** If you use the snippet you are trusting the SDK
— and this suite is the test that a future SDK bump did not change what
propagates.

## The contract

- A valid inbound `traceparent` is **continued**: same trace-id, sampled flag
  preserved, parent-id replaced with this hop's span id (§3.4).
- A **missing or malformed** `traceparent` starts a new trace and never throws,
  never returns 4xx, never panics. A request is not an error because its trace
  header was garbage (§3.2.2.3, §4.2).
- `tracestate` travels with the trace, capped at 512 characters, truncated on
  whole-entry boundaries only (§3.3.1.5).
- A `traceparent` that fails to parse is **not** rescued by a `tracestate`
  alongside it (§3.3) — a tracestate alone is invalid and discarded (§4.2).
- Header names are matched case-insensitively and always sent lowercase (§3.2.1).

## Wiring it in

```python
# Inbound, in a Starlette middleware.
hop = server_hop(request.headers, new_span_id())
request.state.trace_id = hop.trace_id

# Outbound, on an httpx call.
headers.update(hop.outbound_headers)   # stdlib path
# or, with the SDK: inject(headers)  per fastapi.py.snippet
```

`server_hop` returns a `ServerHop` and cannot raise. `parse_traceparent`
returns `None` for anything invalid — that `None` **is** the contract, not a
missing error case.

## Spec sections implemented

Every one of these is asserted in `test_traceparent.py`:

| Section | Rule |
|---------|------|
| §3.2.1 | header name accepted in any case, sent lowercase |
| §3.2.2.1 | version is 2 hex chars; `ff` forbidden |
| §3.2.2.2 | version-00 header format, exactly 55 characters |
| §3.2.2.3 | all-zero trace-id is invalid → ignore the header |
| §3.2.2.4 | all-zero parent-id is invalid → ignore the header |
| §3.2.2.5 | trace-flags is a bit field, masked on read |
| §3.2.2.5.1 | sampled is the only defined flag in version 00 |
| §3.2.2.5.2 | reserved flags MUST be zero on the wire |
| §3.2.4 | higher version: parse positionally, re-emit at 00, drop unknown fields |
| §3.3 | a failed traceparent MUST NOT be rescued by a tracestate |
| §3.3.1.5 | tracestate: ≥512 chars, truncate whole entries only |
| §4.2 / §4.3 | no traceparent → new trace; invalid → restart, never an error |

## Run the suite

```sh
python3 test_traceparent.py

# Under pytest, if the service uses it:
pytest test_traceparent.py -v
```

Stdlib only — `secrets` and `dataclasses`. No `pip install`, so the suite runs on a machine that has never seen this service's venv.

The suite needs **no dependencies and no network** — that is the point of the
codec. If it ever needs a `go mod download` or a `bundle install`, this
template has grown a dependency and kit has stopped being config-only.

Identifier generation uses `secrets`, not `random`, for the same reason as every other language here: trace ids end up in logs and in traces that leave the process, and a predictable one is an invitation to correlate two users' requests by guessing.

## Turn it on in CI

Copy this directory into your service — `templates/otel/python/` — and call
kit's reusable workflow with `telemetry: 'true'`:

```yaml
    with:
      language: python
      telemetry: 'true'
```

That job is opt-in, so adopting kit never turns a green repo red. Once it is
on, this suite runs on every push and a broken codec is a red build rather than
a paragraph in a README.
