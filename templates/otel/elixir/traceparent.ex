# kit template — W3C Trace Context propagation for a Phoenix service.
#
# Copy traceparent.ex into your service (`lib/<app>/telemetry/`), then
# `mix test test/test_traceparent.exs`. The suite travels with it.
#
# The upstream OTel SDK does this for you — see phoenix_telemetry.ex.snippet for
# the versioned wiring. Use this file when you need the header handling on its
# own: a `Req` plug, a PubSub subscriber, or a test that asserts propagation
# without standing up an SDK.
#
# REFERENCE: W3C Trace Context, W3C Recommendation 23 November 2021
# https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/
#
# IMPLEMENTED SECTIONS (every one is asserted in test_traceparent.exs)
#   §3.2.1     header name: accept any case, send lowercase
#   §3.2.2.1   version is 2 hex chars; ff is forbidden
#   §3.2.2.2   version-format for version 00
#   §3.2.2.3   invalid trace-id -> ignore the traceparent (all zeroes forbidden)
#   §3.2.2.4   invalid parent-id -> ignore the traceparent (all zeroes forbidden)
#   §3.2.2.5   trace-flags is a bit field; mask on read
#   §3.2.2.5.1 the sampled flag is the only flag in version 00
#   §3.2.2.5.2 reserved flags MUST be set to zero on the wire
#   §3.2.4     higher version: parse positionally, re-emit at 00, drop unknowns
#   §3.3       a failed traceparent MUST NOT be rescued by a tracestate
#   §3.3.1.5   tracestate: propagate >=512 chars, truncate whole entries only
#   §4.2/§4.3  no traceparent -> new trace; invalid -> restart, never an error
#
# NO DEPENDENCIES. `:crypto`, `:public_key`, and ExUnit. The `:opentelemetry` and
# `:telemetry` hex deps are referenced by version in phoenix_telemetry.ex.snippet,
# not required here — kit has no dependencies and this module must not grow one.
