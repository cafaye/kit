# kit template — W3C Trace Context propagation for a Phoenix service.
#
# Copy traceparent.ex and this file into your service (`lib/<app>/telemetry/`
# and `test/`), then `mix test test/test_traceparent.exs`. The suite is the
# contract: it proves the template still continues a trace instead of quietly
# restarting it.
#
# REFERENCE: W3C Trace Context, W3C Recommendation 23 November 2021
# https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/ — every rule asserted below cites the
# section that requires it.
#
# WHAT IT PROMISES
#   - A valid inbound traceparent is continued: same trace-id, sampled flag
#     preserved, parent-id replaced with this hop's span id (§3.4).
#   - A missing or malformed traceparent starts a new trace and never raises. A
#     request is not a 500 because its trace header was garbage.
#   - tracestate travels with the trace, capped at 512 characters and truncated
#     on whole-entry boundaries (§3.3.1.5).
#
# No dependencies: `:crypto`, `:public_key`, and ExUnit. The `:opentelemetry`
# and `:telemetry` hex deps are referenced by version in
# phoenix_telemetry.ex.snippet, not required here — kit has no dependencies and
# this module must not grow one.

# mix test starts ExUnit; running this file with plain `elixir` does not, so the
# call is here and is a no-op when ExUnit is already running.
