# W3C traceparent — Elixir (Phoenix)

Phoenix's trace propagation, so a request that enters one cafaye service and
leaves it another still reads as **one** trace in a trace view rather than two
unrelated ones.

## Which of the two files do I use

| File | Use it when |
|------|-------------|
| `traceparent.ex` | You need the header handling **on its own**: a queue consumer with no HTTP server, a webhook signer, a background task, or a test that asserts propagation without standing up an SDK. Stdlib only, no dependencies. |
| [`phoenix_telemetry.ex.snippet`](./phoenix_telemetry.ex.snippet) | You are serving Phoenix's requests. The upstream OpenTelemetry SDK already implements all of this and also gives you spans, metrics and a trace UI. Versions are in [../pins.md](../pins.md); kit vendors nothing. |

The snippet is the right answer for a new service. The codec exists for the
cases the SDK does not reach, and for a service that does not want an exporter
at all.

**Keep the suite either way.** If you use the snippet you are trusting the SDK
— and this suite is the test that a future SDK bump did not change what
propagates.

## The contract

- A valid inbound `traceparent` is **continued**: same trace-id, sampled flag
  preserved, parent-id replaced with this hop's span id (§3.4).
- A **missing or malformed** `traceparent` starts a new trace and never throws,
  never returns 4xx, never panics. A request is not an error because its trace
  header was garbage (§3.2.2.3, §4.2).
- `tracestate` travels with the trace, capped at 512 characters, truncated on
  whole-entry boundaries only (§3.3.1.5).
- A `traceparent` that fails to parse is **not** rescued by a `tracestate`
  alongside it (§3.3) — a tracestate alone is invalid and discarded (§4.2).
- Header names are matched case-insensitively and always sent lowercase (§3.2.1).

## Wiring it in

```elixir
# Inbound, in a plug.
hop = KitOtel.Traceparent.server_hop(conn.req_headers, KitOtel.Traceparent.new_span_id())
Logger.metadata(trace_id: hop.trace_id)

# Outbound, on a Req or Finch call.
Req.get(url, headers: hop.outbound_headers())
```

`server_hop/2` returns a `ServerHop`; it has no `!` variant and raises nothing.
`new_span_id/0` is the span id to pass in, so the caller owns the span
lifecycle — which is why the suite can assert equality instead of a shape.

## Spec sections implemented

Every one of these is asserted in `test_traceparent.exs`:

| Section | Rule |
|---------|------|
| §3.2.1 | header name accepted in any case, sent lowercase |
| §3.2.2.1 | version is 2 hex chars; `ff` forbidden |
| §3.2.2.2 | version-00 header format, exactly 55 characters |
| §3.2.2.3 | all-zero trace-id is invalid → ignore the header |
| §3.2.2.4 | all-zero parent-id is invalid → ignore the header |
| §3.2.2.5 | trace-flags is a bit field, masked on read |
| §3.2.2.5.1 | sampled is the only defined flag in version 00 |
| §3.2.2.5.2 | reserved flags MUST be zero on the wire |
| §3.2.4 | higher version: parse positionally, re-emit at 00, drop unknown fields |
| §3.3 | a failed traceparent MUST NOT be rescued by a tracestate |
| §3.3.1.5 | tracestate: ≥512 chars, truncate whole entries only |
| §4.2 / §4.3 | no traceparent → new trace; invalid → restart, never an error |

## Run the suite

```sh
# No mix.exs needed: the module and the suite are standalone.
elixir -r traceparent.ex test_traceparent.exs

# In a real service, with ExUnit already started:
mix test test/test_traceparent.exs
```

The module is a plain `defmodule` and the suite a plain `ExUnit` file, so the whole thing runs without a Mix project. `:crypto` is the only thing it touches, and that is OTP.

The suite needs **no dependencies and no network** — that is the point of the
codec. If it ever needs a `go mod download` or a `bundle install`, this
template has grown a dependency and kit has stopped being config-only.

Elixir spells the predicate `sampled?`, which is correct in isolation and wrong across six languages. `TraceParent.sampled?/1` and `ServerHop.sampled?/1` both exist so the concept has one name here and five others elsewhere, and a reader comparing two templates is not stopped by the suffix.

`:crypto.strong_rand_bytes` is the identifier source; the span-id helper returns a fixed non-zero constant rather than raising if it ever draws all zeroes, because an exhausted entropy source is not a reason to take a service down.

## Turn it on in CI

Copy this directory into your service — `templates/otel/elixir/` — and call
kit's reusable workflow with `telemetry: 'true'`:

```yaml
    with:
      language: elixir
      telemetry: 'true'
```

That job is opt-in, so adopting kit never turns a green repo red. Once it is
on, this suite runs on every push and a broken codec is a red build rather than
a paragraph in a README.
