--     psql "$MIGRATIONS_DATABASE_URL" -f advisor.sql
--     select * from cafaye.advisor_findings();
--
-- WHAT THIS IS. Ten rules over one function, one output shape: every finding is
-- a row carrying `(name, level, facing, categories, description, detail,
-- remediation, metadata, cache_key)`. A gate reads the rows; nothing has to parse
-- anything.
--
-- WHY IT EXISTS BESIDE `substrate.sql` AND THE SIX DRIVERS. Those three grade
-- what the templates SAY: the substrate as text, the assertion set as names, and
-- the boundary as a set of denials RUN against the cluster. None of them can see
-- a policy whose predicate is `true`, because a permissive predicate returns rows
-- and a denial cannot tell "permitted by the predicate" from "permitted by
-- accident". Nor can a file scanner see that two permissive policies on the same
-- (table, role, command) combine with OR. This file grades the LIVE DATABASE, and
-- that is the only layer that can see either.
--
-- TEN RULES, numbered 1-9 plus a 7b, and the numbering is where the ORDER of
-- the findings is and not anything else. The shape is taken from Supabase's
-- database advisor (`pg-meta`'s `studio/advisor/lints.ts`), which is where the
-- row-per-rule union-all query and the nine-column output come from. NOTHING is
-- copied from it: it is MIT-licensed and its own rule is that an adopter must not
-- vendor it, and this repository's rule is that nothing in `moon/refs/` is ever
-- copied in. Every query below was written against this fleet's catalogs, and
-- every one that had to differ says so at the point of the difference.
--
--   1. `policy_exists_rls_disabled`              ERROR   policies, no ENABLE
--   2. `rls_disabled_in_public`                   ERROR   no RLS on a table the API reaches
--   3. `rls_policy_always_true`                   WARN    a permissive predicate that is always true
--   4. `rls_references_user_metadata`             ERROR   an authorization input the caller can edit
--   5. `multiple_permissive_policies`             WARN    >1 permissive policy per (table, role, command)
--   6. `login_role_security_definer_executable`   WARN    SECURITY DEFINER the login role can run
--   7. `auth_rls_initplan`                        WARN    an identity call not wrapped for the InitPlan
--   7b. `rls_policy_correlated_membership`         WARN    an IN (SELECT) correlated to the policy's row
--   8. `rls_enabled_no_policy`                    INFO    RLS on, no policy: the table is unreadable
--   9. `security_definer_view`                    ERROR   a view that enforces its owner's RLS
--
--   TWO OF THOSE NUMBERS ARE NOT TWO RULES. Rule 6 is one rule here and two in
-- the source (`anon_…_security_definer_function_executable` and
-- `authenticated_…`), because the distinction the source draws between "nobody
-- signed in" and "somebody signed in" has no second state in a fleet with no
-- `anon`. And rule 9 was MISSING here for the whole life of this file while
-- being present, ERROR, and category SECURITY in the source: it is
-- `security_definer_view`, and in this fleet it is not a nice-to-have, because
-- the owner of an account-scoped table is itself a NOINHERIT LOGIN role that
-- bypasses its own policies unless the table is FORCE'd. A view that enforces
-- its owner's policies is therefore a hole with nothing watching it, and the
-- whole point of adding the rule is that the hole was real and no lint in this
-- fleet could see it. See the block above rule 9 for the whole argument.
--
--   Rule 8 is the source's `rls_enabled_no_policy`, which is kept because it is
-- the AVAILABILITY half of the boundary and costs one union arm: a table with
-- RLS enabled and no policy denies every row to every role, which is fail-closed
-- and therefore not a security hole, and is also how a migration fails at 3am
-- rather than in review. It is INFO, not ERROR, and the proof in
-- `tests/tenancy_test.sh` asserts zero ERROR/WARN rows precisely so that an INFO
-- here is visible without being a failure.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- WHAT WAS MAPPED, AND WHAT WAS DROPPED. Every substitution is here, not in a
-- separate table, because a rule whose mapping lives somewhere else is a rule
-- whose mapping is out of date.
--
--   `anon` and `authenticated`  ->  ANY NON-OWNER LOGIN ROLE. Supabase has two
--       fixed roles fronting PostgREST, so its rules can name them. kit has
--       `<service>_app`: a per-service LOGIN that owns nothing, is not a
--       superuser, and is the role every request authenticates as. The
--       distinction the source draws between "anonymous" and "signed in"
--       collapses here, which is why rules 2 and 6 are one rule each rather than
--       two: there is no role in this substrate that is not a signed-in caller.
--       That is a real difference and it is a narrowing — a role that is not
--       LOGIN, or is a superuser, or holds BYPASSRLS, is outside both rules
--       exactly as it is outside the source's.
--
--   `pgrst.db_schemas`          ->  `p_schemas`, the argument. PostgREST declares
--       which schemas it exposes in a GUC; kit has no PostgREST, and the honest
--       equivalent is "the schemas this service actually uses", which is a
--       decision rather than a setting. So the scope is an ARGUMENT, and a NULL
--       means the whole database minus the catalog schemas. A caller that means
--       "everything" gets it, and a caller that means "my own tables" says so.
--
--   `auth.uid()`, `auth.jwt()`, `auth.role()`, `auth.email()`  ->
--       `cafaye.current_account_id()` and `cafaye.current_credential_digest()`.
--       These are the substrate's two documented identity seams. Rule 7 looks for
--       an unwrapped call to either, plus a bare `current_setting(`, which is
--       the third of the three the substrate exists to remove.
--
--   `auth.jwt() -> 'user_metadata'`  ->  rule 4, and it is the mapping that
--       changed most (see the block above that rule).
--
--   `pg_policies`  ->  `pg_policy` + `pg_get_expr()`. The source's rules 3 and 4
--       read Supabase's `pg_policies` view, which is a MATERIALIZED VIEW their
--       platform refreshes. Plain Postgres has no such view and no refresh job,
--       so both arms read `pg_policy` and render the expressions with
--       `pg_get_expr`. That is not a translation detail: a materialized view is
--       a cache, and a rule that reads a cache reports what the cache last saw.
--
--   DROPPED, with the reason: `facing` is `INTERNAL` on every row rather than
--       `EXTERNAL`. Supabase's value means "this finding is about the surface
--       PostgREST exposes"; kit exposes no such surface, and a constant column
--       that is always the same value is a column nobody reads.
--
--   DROPPED: the source's per-row `remediation` is a documentation URL. kit
--       ships no URL for a template it hands out, so `remediation` carries the
--       SQL that fixes the finding and the file that explains it. A remediation
--       a caller cannot execute without a second lookup is a second lookup.
--
--   DROPPED: the source's `cache_key` is an opaque string for their dashboard to
--       deduplicate with. Here it is the same string, and it is kept because it
--       is the one column that is stable across runs — so a gate can diff two
--       runs by it. It is not needed to read a finding and it is not decoration.

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- THE SCOPE ARGUMENT, and the one thing to know before reading a row.
--
-- `p_schemas` filters by SCHEMA and nothing else. A NULL is the whole database
-- minus `pg_catalog`, `information_schema`, `pg_toast` and every `pg_%` schema,
-- which is the smallest exclusion that is not a list of other people's business:
-- the source excludes thirty named extension schemas, and every one of those is
-- a schema `pg_%` or `information_schema` already covers, or a schema some other
-- platform put its extensions in.
--
-- Extension-owned tables are excluded by `pg_depend.deptype = 'e'`, for the same
-- reason `substrate.sql`'s sweep excludes them and in the same words: pgvector
-- and friends ship their own tables with their own grants, and reporting a table
-- this substrate cannot protect trains the reader to ignore the report.
--
-- IT STANDS ALONE. Nothing here calls a `cafaye.*` function the substrate owns,
-- and that is deliberate rather than tidy. A checker that only exists where the
-- thing it checks has already been installed cannot find a service that has NOT
-- installed it — which is the service that needs it. So rule 5's recognition of a
-- substrate-written policy, which is the one place the substrate's own naming
-- convention appears, is inlined rather than delegated to
-- `cafaye.credential_tables()`. What is duplicated is the two PREDICATE SHAPES,
-- and the comment above each says which catalog it reads.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- WHAT THIS DOES NOT FIND, because a rule that reads as a promise it cannot keep
-- is worse than no rule.
--
--   * That a policy's predicate is the RIGHT predicate. Rule 3 finds `true`;
--       nothing here can tell a policy that is subtly too wide from one that is
--       exactly right, because "right" is a property of the service's data model
--       and this function has never read it.
--
--   * That the service SETS the identity. `cafaye.begin_account/1` is one call in
--       one place. A service that never calls it reads zero rows, which is safe
--       and loud, and no rule in this file can tell it from a service whose
--       tables are empty.
--
--   * That the login role is not a MEMBER of the owner role, that the login role
--       holds no BYPASSRLS, and that the owner's FORCE is set. The last is
--       `relforcerowsecurity`, and this file has no rule for it on purpose:
--       `substrate.sql`'s sweep names it and `isolation.sql` asserts it by
--       RUNNING the denials as the owner, because a catalog reading can be
--       satisfied by a table nobody reads. One file claiming all three would
--       mean one file where a reader looks for the proof and finds a column.
--
--   * THAT ITS OWN ANSWER IS THE SAME FOR EVERY ROLE. Every rule here reads
--       `pg_get_expr`, which deparses a name unqualified whenever the READER's
--       `search_path` resolves it, so this function's findings are a function of
--       who runs it. Both spellings are accepted above, which is a mitigation and
--       not a fix: the shape `(cafaye\.)?` accepts is one narrow family, and a
--       third spelling would be missed rather than reported.
--       `substrate.sql`'s `credential_tables()` had the same defect in the worst
--       possible form — it reported NO credential table at all to the role whose
--       `"$user"` schema is `cafaye` — and it no longer does, because it resolves
--       the same facts from `pg_depend`. That function can do that here too and
--       does not: these rules are about what a predicate SAYS, and the predicate
--       `using (true)` is invisible in every dependency catalog. Closing this
--       properly means deciding what a rule claims when it cannot see the text,
--       which is a change to the RULES and not to a regexp — deliberately out of
--       scope here, and written down rather than left for a reader to infer.
--
--   * WHAT A VIEW PROJECTS. Rule 9 asks "does this view read a table that has
--       row level security", and it asks it of `pg_depend`, which records the
--       RELATION a rewrite rule reaches and not which columns it selects. So a
--       view over an account-scoped table that projects one non-account column
--       is reported exactly as loudly as one that projects the whole table. That
--       is the same trade rule 4's keyword half makes and it is kept for the
--       same reason: narrowing it means parsing `pg_get_viewdef`, and a rule
--       that reads view text has its misses where nobody is looking. The detail
--       names the tables, so the reader can make that judgement in one read.
--
--   * WHETHER THE OWNER IS ALSO THE CALLER. `pg_depend` says which relations a
--       view reaches; it does not say who could have read them directly. Rule 9
--       does not need that distinction, and the reason is this fleet's: the
--       owner of an account-scoped table IS a NOINHERIT LOGIN role that bypasses
--       its own policies unless the table is FORCE'd, so owner-is-the-caller and
--       owner-is-another-service are the same hole with a different blast
--       radius. The detail names the owner so a reader who wants the narrower
--       story has it.

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- rule 5's exemption, stated here because it is the only judgement in this file
-- and MD24 is the reason it exists.
--
-- MD24 gives every credential table FIVE policies: one per command from
-- `protect_table`, plus a `for select` from `protect_credential_table` whose
-- predicate is the digest the CALLER PRESENTED. So `(api_keys, alpha, SELECT)`
-- holds two permissive policies, and the source's rule reads that as a
-- performance defect. It is not a defect; it is the mechanism, and the two
-- predicates combine as
--
--     (account_id = the session's account) OR (token_digest = the digest presented)
--
-- which is exactly what MD24 says it means: your account's rows, or the one
-- credential row you named. Collapsing them into one policy would mean writing a
-- policy that ORs a digest, which is the shape `substrate.sql` argues against in
-- the comment above `protect_credential_table`.
--
-- So the rule stays at WARN and unsoftened, and the EXEMPTION is the rule's own
-- semantics rather than an allowlist of names:
--
--     a (table, role, command) group is exempt when EVERY policy in it was
--     written by the substrate.
--
-- It is an all-of condition and that is the whole design. An allowlist keyed on
-- policy NAMES (`%_cafaye_resolve`) is a ratchet: a service that renames a
-- policy gets a red it cannot fix, and a service that adds a THIRD permissive
-- policy next to the exempt two still passes. Under this exemption the substrate
-- writes `account_users`'s four policies and `api_keys`'s five, all recognised,
-- group exempt — and the moment a service hand-writes a second permissive SELECT
-- on `api_keys`, the group is no longer all-of and the rule fires, naming the
-- hand-written one. That is the shape this file has to be able to reach, and the
-- fixture in `tests/tenancy_test.sh` reaches it.

-- (3) EVERY POLICY IN SCOPE, with its expressions RENDERED.
--
--     `pg_get_expr` is a pretty-printer, not the text that was executed: the

--     the catalog gives back
--     `(account_id = ( SELECT cafaye.current_account_id() AS current_account_id))`
--     — its own capitalisation, spacing and generated alias. Every regexp below
--     is written against the RENDERED form, and a regexp written against the
--     executed form matches nothing here and looks for ever afterwards like a
--     rule that found nothing.
--
--     AND THE SCHEMA QUALIFICATION IN THAT OUTPUT IS NOT FIXED, which is a
--     measurement rather than a caveat. `pg_get_expr` drops the schema from a
--     name the READER can resolve, and what the reader can resolve is their
--     `search_path`. Measured on this kit, reading the same policy twice:
--
--         as role `alpha`   search_path = "$user", public   ($user = a schema
--                           named `alpha`, which does not exist)
--                             -> (account_id = ( SELECT cafaye.current_account_id() …))
--
--         as role `cafaye`  search_path = "$user", public   ($user = a schema
--                           named `cafaye`, which DOES exist)
--                             -> (account_id = ( SELECT current_account_id() …))
--
--     `"$user"` is the whole mechanism, and it means the cluster's own admin
--     role — the one named after the platform — reads the substrate's policies in
--     the short form.
--
--     So every regexp below accepts BOTH forms, and the comment says why rather
--     than leaving `(cafaye\.)?` looking like sloppiness. Requiring the qualified
--     form alone makes rule 5 report MD24's credential policy as a hand-written
--     one to exactly the reader least likely to know why, and makes rule 7
--     silently miss a bare call for the same reader. A rule that is blind under
--     one search_path is the defect this comment exists to prevent.
--
--     `substrate.sql`'s `credential_tables()` had exactly this defect and no
--     longer has it: it read a regexp over this text and returned NOTHING to the
--     `cafaye` role while returning everything to `alpha`, which is an audit
--     telling the cluster's own admin role that this database holds no credential
--     path. It now resolves the same two facts from `pg_depend` — OIDs rather
--     than spelling — and `tests/tenancy_test.sh` asserts all three roles get one
--     answer. THIS FILE STILL READS THE TEXT, because every rule here is about
--     what a predicate SAYS (`using (true)` is a predicate no dependency catalog
--     records as anything but a boolean), so `(cafaye\.)?` stays and the residual
--     limitation is listed under "what this does not find" rather than left for a
--     reader to infer.

-- (8) EVERY VIEW IN SCOPE, THE TABLES IT REACHES, AND WHETHER IT IS AN INVOKER.
--     Resolved from `pg_depend` and NOT from `pg_get_viewdef`.
--
--     The catalog answer is available and it is the right one: Postgres records a
--     view's rewrite rule as depending on each relation the view reads, so
--     `pg_depend` with `classid = pg_rewrite` names the tables by OID. That is
--     the same mechanism rule 4's catalog half uses for a policy's expression,
--     and for the same reason — it survives renaming, it needs no parsing, and a
--     parse of view text is a parse whose misses are silent. `pg_get_viewdef`
--     would additionally have the `search_path` defect recorded three CTEs
--     above, which is a third way to answer this question that would be right
--     for one reader and wrong for another.
--
--     `security_invoker` is read from `reloptions` rather than inferred, and the
--     regexp accepts the three boolean spellings Postgres itself accepts. The
--     stored form is canonical (`security_invoker=true`), so this is a
--     mitigation for a future writer rather than a repair of a measured one —
--     stated as such so a reader does not go looking for the measurement.
--
--     `relkind = 'v'` and nothing else. A MATERIALIZED view is excluded

--
--     THE DEPENDENCY GRAPH IS WALKED TRANSITIVELY, and the reason is that a
--     view over a view is the SAME hole rather than a milder one. Postgres
--     evaluates the outer view with the outer view's owner's privileges, and the
--     inner view with the inner one's; there is no point in that chain where a
--     caller's policies come back into force. So `report_v` over
--     `account_summary` over `account_users` reads every account's rows exactly
--     as `account_summary` does, and a rule that stopped at the first hop would
--     report the inner view and stay silent about the one a caller actually
--     queries. Measured on this fixture: `nested_view` reads only `definer_view`
--     and no RLS'd table directly, and it reads every row `definer_view` reads.
--
--     `DISTINCT` in `view_reads` is not tidiness. `pg_depend` records one row
--     per (rewrite rule, reference), and a view that names a table twice in its
--     body records it twice here: measured, `{plain, plain}` — one relation,
--     reported as two.
--
--     The self-reference row (`refobjid = the view's own oid`, `deptype = 'i'`)
--     is dropped by the relkind filter rather than by an oid comparison,
--     because it is the only row in this join whose `refobjid` is the view
--     itself and the filter says so in the same word as everything else.

--    generalisation: a role kit did not know about when the rule was written
--    is in scope, which a hard-coded pair of role names would miss.
--
--    `has_table_privilege` includes privileges held through PUBLIC and through

--    are different — a permissive write predicate that is always true lets a
--    caller write any row, which is the shape every "we'll tighten it later"
--    policy takes.
--
--    The NULL clause is half of it and is the half nobody writes: an INSERT has
--    no `using` (there is no existing row to filter) so a permissive INSERT with
--    a NULL `with check` permits every row anybody offers it. `normalize` is
--    what makes `USING ( TRUE )`, `USING (1=1)` and `USING ((true))` one
--    finding rather than three near-misses.

-- 4. `rls_references_user_metadata` — an authorization input the caller can
--    EDIT. This is the rule that changed most, and the change is the reason the
--    rule earns ERROR rather than being dropped along with the `auth` schema.
--
--    THE SOURCE'S RULE, IN ITS OWN TERMS: `auth.users.user_metadata` is editable
--    by the end user, so a policy that consults it consults something the user
--    controls. The source admits at `:821-822` that it cannot do better than a
--    string match: "False positives are possible, but it isn't practical to
--    string match."
--
--    THE HALF THAT IS PORTED VERBATIM, caveat and all. A policy mentioning
--    `user_metadata`, `raw_user_meta_data` or `app_metadata` is flagged whether
--    or not this fleet ever writes one, because the caveat is the point: this
--    half is a keyword search and says so.
--
--    THE HALF THAT IS NOT, and it is the reason this rule stays. Postgres records
--    a policy's dependencies: `pg_depend` holds a row per relation the policy
--    EXPRESSION reaches outside its own table. So "does this policy's predicate
--    read a table a caller can write" is a question about the catalog, not
--    about the text — and it is the shape of `user_metadata` exactly. A service
--    that keeps a `profile_flags` / `memberships` / `is_admin` table and writes
--    `using (exists (select 1 from profile_flags f where f.is_admin))` has built
--    its own `user_metadata`, and no keyword search finds it: the name is the
--    service's, the column is the service's, and the words `user_metadata` appear
--    nowhere. Supabase's rule could only ever report the half it could spell.
--
--    A column OF the policy's own table is not a hit, and that exclusion is not
--    cosmetic: `recordDependencyOnSingleRelExpr` deliberately does not record
--    self-references, so `using (account_id = ...)` produces no row here and the
--    substrate's own policies are silent.

-- 6. `login_role_security_definer_executable` — a SECURITY DEFINER function
--    the application login role can run. One rule, where the source has two:
--    `anon_…` and `authenticated_…` differ only in whether the caller signed in,
--    and in this substrate every caller is a role that can log in. The source's
--    distinction has no third state to fall into, and inventing one would be a
--    rule about a topology kit does not run.
--
--    A `SECURITY DEFINER` function runs with its OWNER's privileges and with the
--    owner's exemption from row-level security unless FORCE applies to it — so a
--    definer that is a table owner is an owner bypass behind a function
--    signature. `substrate.sql` writes none: every function it owns is an invoker,
--    which is why `pg_proc.prosecdef` is worth a rule here and finds nothing.

-- 7b. `rls_policy_correlated_membership` — an `IN (SELECT …)` whose subquery
--     is CORRELATED to the policy's own row, so Postgres evaluates the membership
--     lookup once per candidate row instead of once per statement.
--
--    MEASURED, ON THIS KIT, BY `tests/rls_perf_test.sh` — and the number is the
--    packet's, re-measured rather than repeated. 200,000 rows, a membership table
--    of 200 rows indexed in BOTH directions, run as a `<service>_app` login with
--    `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` on every policy table, through
--    `cafaye.begin_account` / `cafaye.current_account_id()`:
--
--        correlated  `X in (select … where m.s = slow_doc.subject_account_id)`
--                    2000 ms, and the plan's own loop counter reads
--                    `loops=200000` on the membership scan.
--
--        inverted    `slow_doc.subject_account_id in (select … where m.c =
--                    (select cafaye.current_account_id()))`
--                    18 ms, and the loop counter reads `loops=1`.
--
--        i.e. 111x on this fixture, where the reference reports 450x on its own
--        data. THE NUMBER IS NOT THE CLAIM AND NEITHER IS THE RATIO: the ratio is
--        set by the membership table's size — a per-row probe of a 200-row table
--        is cheap per row and ruinous in aggregate — and by the row count. What
--        transfers is the direction and the mechanism, and the mechanism is what
--        this rule reads off the catalog.
--
--    WHY `protect_table` CANNOT EMIT THIS SHAPE, which is the finding that makes
--    the rule cheap rather than noisy. `protect_table` writes
--    `account_id = (select cafaye.current_account_id())` — a column comparison
--    against a function, with no membership table anywhere in the predicate. There
--    is no join to invert because there is no join. The slow shape is only
--    reachable by a service HAND-WRITING a policy, which is the same population
--    rule 3, 5 and 7 already watch.
--
--    WHAT IT MATCHES, EXACTLY, because a rule that matches correlation in general
--    matches the whole fleet and is a report nobody reads:
--
--      * An `in (select …)` or `= any (select …)` — and an `IN (SELECT …)`
--        subquery contains a reference to the POLICY'S OWN TABLE. Inside a
--        subquery, a reference to the outer relation IS the definition of
--        correlation, so this is not a heuristic about shape: it is the property.
--        The subquery text is EXTRACTED (`regexp_matches`) and the reference is
--        looked for inside it, because a regexp cannot see past its own closing
--        paren — and the self-reference sits inside one, so a single regexp over
--        the whole qualifier misses the very case it was written for. That is
--        measured, not assumed: the correlated predicate deparsed to
--        `…in(select m.caller_account from perf.member_of m where
--        (m.subject_account = slow_doc.subject_account_id))`, where the
--        self-reference is inside the nested `WHERE (…)` group.
--
--      * BOTH deparse spellings of the relation, for the `search_path` reason
--        recorded above: `slow_doc.subject_account_id` to a reader who cannot
--        resolve `perf`, and `perf.slow_doc.subject_account_id` to one who can.
--        Measured on this fixture, the reader's `search_path` decided which one
--        the catalog returned, so requiring the qualified form would make this
--        rule blind to exactly the reader least likely to know why.
--
--    WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT MATCH, and the measurement is the reason:
--
--      * `exists (select 1 from link l where l.doc_id = doc.id and …)`. The
--        outer hop of that shape is correlated and CANNOT be inverted — `doc` has
--        no membership column of its own, so there is no row column to `IN`
--        against — and yet it measured 56 ms against the correlated form's 2000 ms,
--        because with the INNER hop inverted Postgres re-associates the `EXISTS`
--        into a semi-join and resolves the membership ONCE. The plan showed
--        `Filter: (ANY (id = (hashed SubPlan 4).col1))` over a nested loop with
--        `loops=4`. So the boundary is PER HOP, not per policy, and a rule that
--        fired on correlation in general would fire on the shape that is already
--        fast — which is how a performance rule gets switched off.
--
--      * A correlated subquery in any other position. `and other.x = doc.y`
--        outside the `IN` is not this rule, and neither is a hand-rolled
--        `join`-shaped `WITH CHECK`.
--
--    THE RESIDUAL LIMITS, in the file's usual place rather than left to be
--    inferred: this reads the deparsed TEXT, for the same reason every other rule
--    here does and for the same recorded cost (`(cafaye\.)?`-style blindness under
--    one `search_path`); the `([^()]|\([^()]*\))*` arity is ONE level of nesting
--    inside the `IN`, so a membership subquery nested two deep is missed rather
--    than misreported; and it cannot tell a membership check from any other
--    correlated lookup, because `doc.row` inside an `IN (SELECT …)` is the same
--    text either way. All three are false NEGATIVES, chosen over false positives
--    on purpose.

--
--    THE MEASUREMENT IS KIT'S OWN and it is in `tests/tenancy_test.sh`: five

-- 9. `security_definer_view` — a view that enforces its OWNER's row-level
--    security rather than the caller's.
--
--    THE HOLE, in one sentence. Postgres gives a view the privileges and the
--    row-level-security EXEMPTION of the role that created it, so a view over an
--    account-scoped table enforces the policies that apply to its owner — and a
--    policy that applies to the owner is not a policy at all, because the owner
--    bypasses its own policies unless the table is FORCE'd. Writing a view over
--    `account_users` is therefore a way to hand every caller who can reach it
--    every account's rows, and it reads in review as a SELECT.
--
--    WHY THIS FILE WAS THE ONLY PLACE THAT COULD CATCH IT, and why it is ERROR
--    here rather than WARN: kit's boundary is per-service NOINHERIT login roles
--    that OWN their tables, so "the owner is exempt from its own policies" is
--    not a corner case of the definer model — it is every table in the fleet.
--    The reference's rule is `security_definer_view` at its `lints.ts:604-614`,
--    level ERROR, category SECURITY, and what is ported here is the SHAPE: the
--    same nine columns, one union arm per rule, the same level vocabulary.
--
--    THE THREE NARROWINGS, each of which is the difference between a rule that
--    is trusted and a rule that is switched off:
--
--      * A view with `security_invoker = true` is NOT this finding, because such
--        a view runs its queries as the caller and therefore enforces the
--        CALLER's policies. That is the entire remedy, so reporting it would be
--        reporting the fix as the disease.
--
--      * A view that reads no table with row level security is NOT this finding.
--        There is no policy to bypass, and views over reference tables or a bare
--        `select 1` are most views in a real schema. This guard is what stops the
--        rule from becoming "every view in the database is an ERROR".
--
--      * A view no login role can SELECT is NOT this finding — `has_table_
--        privilege`, not a grant scan, for rule 2's reason: a grant is not the
--        capability, and a role that inherits SELECT reaches a view nobody
--        granted it to.
--
--    AND THE RESIDUAL LIMITS, listed here rather than left for a reader to infer:
--    it asks whether the view reads an RLS'd TABLE, not whether that table is in
--    another schema or on another cluster; and it does not resolve view TEXT, so
--    a view projecting one non-account column over an account-scoped table is
--    reported as loudly as one projecting the whole table. Both are in "what
--    this does not find", and the second is the same trade rule 4's keyword half
--    makes: narrowing it means parsing `pg_get_viewdef`, and a parse's misses are
--    silent.
--
--    THE VERSION FLOOR, because it changes what the rule MEANS rather than what
--    it matches. `security_invoker` arrived in Postgres 15. On 14 or older the
--    option does not exist, so `CREATE VIEW ... WITH (security_invoker = true)`
--    is refused and EVERY view in the database is a definer view — which means
--    this rule fires on every view over an RLS'd table, and every one of those
--    findings is TRUE. There is no flag to set and no way to silence one, so a
--    service on an old server sees an ERROR it cannot fix by remediation. That is
--    reported in the `remediation` column rather than in this comment, because a
--    reader who acts on the finding is the one who needs it:
--
--        When current_setting('server_version_num')::int < 150000 the remediation
--        names the version rather than printing an ALTER that would be refused.
--
--    This fleet's floor is PG15 (`templates/compose/postgres/Dockerfile`, and
--    MD21b's PG17), so on kit's own cluster the branch is unreachable — which is
--    exactly why it is written rather than left implicit. A checker that means
--    something different on two supported server versions is not a checker that
--    can be trusted on either.
