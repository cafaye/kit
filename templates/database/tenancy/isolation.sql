-- kit template — the assertion set that proves an account boundary.
--
--     psql "$MIGRATIONS_DATABASE_URL" -f isolation.sql
--
-- ONE FILE, SIX LANGUAGES. This is the whole assertion set, and it is one file
-- because the assertions are about POSTGRES rather than about a language: the
-- denial a request meets is a denial Postgres returns. Each language's driver
-- (`templates/database/<lang>/tenancy_test.*`) runs this script and then asserts,
-- BY NAME, that every row below came back and that every verdict is `pass`. A
-- driver that stops naming them goes red, which is what makes six thin drivers
-- safe rather than six copies to keep in step.
--
-- THE SHAPE IS THREE DENIALS AND ONE ALLOWANCE, and it is three rather than one
-- because one proves nothing:
--
--   no identity                                   reads zero rows
--   ANOTHER tenant's VALID identity, on its rows  reads zero rows
--   its OWN identity                              reads its own rows, and not the other's
--
-- The first is satisfied by a table with no policy at all — which is the bug — and
-- the last is satisfied by a policy that permits everything. Only the three
-- together are the property, and each is run against BOTH roles: the login role
-- the application authenticates as, and the owner the service's migrations run as.
--
-- WHY THE OWNER IS IN THERE. Postgres exempts a table's OWNER from its own
-- policies unless `ALTER TABLE ... FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` says otherwise, and
-- every service in this fleet runs its migrations as its own role — so the owner
-- IS the role that builds these tables, and the role a developer has open in
-- `psql`. Without FORCE every denial above passes for the login role and the
-- owner reads everything. Measured on this kit, a protected three-row table, read
-- as the owner with another tenant's identity:
--
--     with FORCE      1 row    (its own)
--     without FORCE   3 rows   (every tenant's)
--
-- `FORCE` is not in Supabase's row-level-security guide, no lint in this fleet
-- checks for it, and a table with policies, `relrowsecurity = true` and no FORCE
-- looks completely correct in review. That is why the owner half exists, and why
-- it is the half that cannot be satisfied by a policy which is merely present.
--
-- TWO CONTROLS, because a green answer from a check that cannot see its own
-- defect is worse than no answer at all:
--
--   `sweep/names-an-unprotected-table`      `cafaye.unprotected_tables()` really
--                                            does report a table with an
--                                            `account_id` column and no policies.
--                                            Without it, the sweep's empty result
--                                            is satisfied by a sweep that reports
--                                            nothing.
--                                            The control lives in `pg_temp`, which
--                                            is why the sweep's scope includes this
--                                            session's temporary schema: a control
--                                            outside the thing it controls is not a
--                                            control.
--   `policies/written-for-the-init-plan`    every policy qualifier is a subquery,
--                                            not a bare call. Measured on this
--                                            kit, five rows, one query: the
--                                            wrapped form calls once, the bare
--                                            form five times.
--
-- HOW TO RUN IT, AND WHAT IT LEAVES BEHIND.
--
--   Run it as a role that may `SET ROLE`: the owner. kit's cluster grants
--   `<service>_app` TO `<service>` for exactly this, and impersonating a strictly
--   weaker role cannot widen anything.
--
--   It opens a transaction and does NOT close it. Two things need one: the
--   identity is transaction-local (so a caller in autocommit reads zero rows and
--   every case would pass for the wrong reason), and `SET LOCAL ROLE` is refused
--   outside a transaction block. Every object it creates is TEMPORARY, so it
--   disappears with the session whether the session commits or rolls back — there
--   is nothing here that can outlive the connection, and no cleanup step to
--   forget. Roll back when you are done.
--
-- The output is one table. `verdict` is `pass` or `fail`; `expected` and `actual`
-- are text so a driver's comparison is a string equality in all six languages;
-- and `why` says what the assertion is FOR, so a red row is diagnosable from the
-- report alone rather than by opening this file.
