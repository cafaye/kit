-- kit template — the ACCOUNT boundary inside one service's database.
--
--     psql "$MIGRATIONS_DATABASE_URL" -f substrate.sql
--
-- WHAT THIS IS. One schema, one GUC, one setter, one function that protects a
-- table, and one sweep that says whether the service is still isolated. Postgres
-- enforces the account boundary; the application does not have to remember to.
--
-- WHY IT EXISTS HERE AND NOT IN EACH SERVICE. Across the nine account-scoped
-- services there is not one `ROW LEVEL SECURITY`, not one `CREATE POLICY` and not
-- one non-owner login role. Tenancy is enforced entirely by hand-written
-- `WHERE account_id = ?` in six languages, which means it is one forgotten
-- predicate per query per service and the whole suite stays green. A boundary
-- that lives in application code is only as strong as the least recently
-- reviewed query. This is the same trade kit already makes with the database
-- itself, where the boundary is `REVOKE` and not good intentions.
--
-- THE TWO ROLES, AND WHY ONE OF THEM IS THE POINT.
--
--   <service>       the owner. LOGIN, owns the database and every table, runs
--                   migrations. This is the role kit's cluster already
--                   provisions and a service already uses, so adopting this
--                   changes nothing about how a service builds its schema.
--   <service>_app   the LOGIN the application uses. It owns nothing, so it
--                   cannot `ALTER TABLE ... DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`, drop a
--                   policy, or truncate around one. It is granted DML and
--                   nothing else.
--
-- FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY is still required, and it is required for the OWNER.
-- Postgres exempts a table's owner from its own policies; `FORCE` is what removes
-- that exemption. Without it a table whose policies are all in place still reads
-- as fully protected while the role that owns it reads every account's rows, and
-- nothing reports that: the policies are there, `relrowsecurity` is true, and
-- the owner walks straight past them. It is the one setting on this page that
-- Supabase's row-level-security guide does not document and that no lint in this
-- fleet checks for, which is why `templates/database/tenancy/isolation.sql`
-- asserts it by RUNNING the denials as the owner rather than by grepping for it.
--
-- THE CONSEQUENCE, STATED HERE BECAUSE IT WILL SURPRISE SOMEONE. Once a table is
-- protected, the OWNER reads zero rows from it too — no policy names the owner,
-- and FORCE removed the exemption that used to let it through. That is the
-- correct posture and it is also the adoption cost: a migration that has to read
-- or backfill rows either sets the identity (`set local role <service>_app` plus
-- `begin_account`) or goes through a `SECURITY DEFINER` function. A migration
-- that silently reads zero rows fails immediately, which is the good direction,
-- but it is a change to how a service writes backfills and it is worth knowing
-- before the first one runs rather than after.
--
-- THE `(select ...)` WRAPPING IS NOT STYLE.
--
--   using (      cafaye.current_account_id() = account_id )      -- per ROW
--   using ( (select cafaye.current_account_id()) = account_id )  -- per STATEMENT
--
-- Postgres evaluates a bare function call in a policy qualifier once per
-- candidate row and hoists an uncorrelated scalar subquery into an InitPlan that
-- runs once per statement. Measured on this kit, five rows, one call:
--
--     using (account_id = (select probe_id()))   ->  1 call
--     using (account_id = probe_id())            ->  5 calls
--
-- and `tests/tenancy_test.sh` re-measures it on every run, because a comment
-- saying so is not a measurement and this is the sort of difference that is
-- invisible until the table is large, which is the worst time to find it.
-- `protect_table` only ever writes the wrapped form. A hand-written policy that
-- writes the bare form is correct and slow, and nothing in a normal run will
-- ever notice.
--
-- WHAT IS NOT HERE. No JWT parsing, no token format, no session store, and no
-- `auth.uid()`. How a service turns the credential in its hand into an account
-- is that service's own business — identity issues opaque session tokens and
-- guard verifies JWKS bearer JWTs, and a template that picked one of those would
-- be wrong for the other. The seam is `cafaye.begin_account/1`, and a service
-- calls it once per request from whatever it already authenticates.
--
-- Idempotent, deliberately: this is a migration, migrations get re-run by
-- `down`/`up` and by `bin/dev down -v`, and `protect_table` drops and recreates
-- its policies so a re-run converges rather than failing on a duplicate name.

-- Its own schema, and not `public`, so `cafaye` is never part of a sweep over
-- the service's tables and never collides with a name the service chose.

-- THE ONE SEAM.
--
--   returns NULL when no account has been set  ->  every policy reads zero rows
--   raises      when the value is not a uuid   ->  a plumbing bug, loudly
--
-- The NULL is the load-bearing half and it is deliberate. "No identity" and "an
-- identity that owns none of these rows" are indistinguishable by construction,
-- which is core's `docs/tenancy.md` D33 arriving from the other end: a policy that
-- raised on an absent identity would tell a caller its request was not
-- authenticated, and a caller can be made to believe that about somebody else's
-- request.
--
-- The raise is the other half, and it is not a contradiction. An ABSENT identity
-- is a legitimate state that must read as nothing. A MALFORMED one is a bug in
-- the service's own plumbing, and reading nothing would report it as a service
-- with no data, which is the worst possible way to find out.

-- ===========================================================================
-- CREDENTIAL RESOLUTION — the one query whose subject the boundary does not
-- know yet. Read this before changing anything below; MD24 is the decision and
-- its cost, and DECISIONS.md is where the alternatives are recorded as dead.
-- ===========================================================================
--
-- THE PROBLEM, IN ONE SENTENCE. A scoped token, an invitation token and a
-- client id all resolve by "find the row by an unguessable value and learn the
-- account from it", and the account is WHAT THE QUERY IS FOR — so a query with
-- no identity cannot be scoped by an identity it has not computed yet. Measured
-- by `identity` against its real protected `api_keys` table, as the OWNER:
--
--     no identity (the state a token request is in)      0 rows
--     identity = the credential's own account            1 row
--     identity = another tenant's identity               0 rows
--
-- The first line is the finding, and it is the quietest one available: the token
-- does not resolve, `ErrNoRows` becomes "not found", and the HTTP layer answers
-- 401. Every machine credential, refused as though it did not exist.
--
-- WHY NOT THE OTHER THREE ANSWERS. Each is measured or read rather than
-- assumed, and each is written down in `DECISIONS.md` (MD24):
--
--   * A `BYPASSRLS` role — Supabase's answer, and right for Supabase's
--     topology: `service_role` is `nologin noinherit bypassrls` granted only to
--     `authenticator`, and what bounds it is who may assume it plus its object
--     grants. kit has one per-request role and no separate service layer, so a
--     bypass role here is a bypass over the WHOLE DATABASE held by the role
--     every request already authenticates as.
--   * A `SECURITY DEFINER` function — does not work under FORCE. FORCE applies
--     to the definer, and only BYPASSRLS skips RLS; no service role has one.
--   * Dropping FORCE — MD23's measurement: 1 row with, 3 without, on the one
--     table holding every machine credential.
--
-- WHAT IS HERE INSTEAD. One extra `for select` policy, whose qualifier is the
-- value the CALLER PRESENTED, read from a transaction-local GUC:
--
--     using (token_digest = (select cafaye.current_credential_digest()))
--
-- The predicate is in the POLICY and not only in the caller's query, and that is
-- the whole design rather than a detail. RLS policies combine permissively, so a
-- policy that said merely "a credential session may select this table" would hand
-- the caller a table-wide SELECT and let it browse every key in the database
-- with the one query this mechanism exists to prevent. Because the policy
-- carries the same predicate the query carries, the honest semantics are:
--
--     A resolution session may read exactly the credential row whose digest it
--     presented, and nothing else in the database.
--
-- `select * from api_keys` inside one of these sessions returns THAT row, not
-- the table. `isolation.sql` asserts it as `credential/resolution-cannot-browse`
-- and asserts the other half — that the mechanism did not become a general
-- bypass — as `credential/resolution-does-not-open-another-table`.
--
-- WHAT IT CANNOT DO, all five, so nobody has to find them:
--
--   1. It cannot tell a secret from a label. It widens a read to the row whose
--      value you presented, and whether that value is unguessable is the
--      SERVICE's knowledge. `oidc_clients.client_id` is an identifier, not a
--      secret, and this is the wrong mechanism for it. The invariant that keeps
--      the mechanism from becoming a general bypass is exactly that one: you can
--      only widen a read to a row you could already name.
--   2. It cannot write. `for select`, so every write policy still demands an
--      account identity: a resolution session cannot mint a credential.
--   3. It does not open any other table. It is a policy on a named table, and
--      `account_users` still reads zero rows in a resolution session.
--   4. It is transaction-local, like `begin_account/1`, and that is not tidiness
--      — the six drivers hold pools, and a session-level digest survives the
--      pool and hands one resolution's credential to the next connection.
--   5. It is not audited at runtime. The GUC leaves nothing behind; what IS
--      auditable is the SCOPE, and `credential_tables()` below is the one query
--      that answers "which tables in this database can be read with no account".
--      A claim this file cannot honour would be a comment pretending to be a
--      control, so it is not made.
--
-- TWO SEAMS, NOT ONE. `begin_credential/1` is a second transaction-local GUC and
-- the cost of that is real and is why the substrate has no third. It is set in
-- exactly one function, so a service has exactly one place that writes it.

-- The digest the session is resolving. NULL when none is set, and the NULL is
-- load-bearing for the same reason `current_account_id()`'s is: with no digest
-- set, `token_digest = NULL` is never true, so a table carrying only a resolve
-- policy plus an account policy reads nothing at all rather than raising. A
-- credential table is still fully protected without a digest — this policy only
-- ever ADDS the one row whose digest is present.

  --    background work and migrations as that role discovers it by seeing empty
  --    result sets. Naming it means the owner's reads are ACCOUNT-SCOPED rather
  --    than absent: a migration sets an identity and reads exactly one account's
  --    rows, which is the same rule every other request obeys and the only version
  --    of "the owner may read" that is not "the owner may read everything".
  --
  --    One policy per command rather than one `for all` is what keeps a later
  --    grant additive — a policy added for one command cannot widen another. The
  --    `for all` shape with `using (true)` and `with check (...)` is the one that
  --    silently permits an INSERT nobody meant to permit, and it is the shape
  --    every "permissive RLS policy" lint is written to flag.
  --
  --    `insert` has no `using` — an INSERT has no existing row to filter — and
  --    its `with check` is what stops a row being created in somebody else's
  --    account, which is the write-side twin of the read denial.
  --
  --    DROP before CREATE so the function is re-runnable, and so a policy whose
  --    definition has been corrected here cannot survive a re-run.

  --    time somebody adds a privilege, and this is the one place that list lives.
  --
  --    USAGE on `cafaye` is in the list and is not optional: without it the login
  --    role cannot resolve `cafaye.begin_account/1` at all, so the first thing a

-- SWEEP: every account-scoped table in the schemas THIS SUBSTRATE OWNS,
-- protected or not.
--
-- Returns one row per table that is NOT, so a caller can report all of them
-- rather than the first. It returns rather than raising because a caller that
-- gets rows can print them, and a caller that gets an exception has to parse the
-- message. This is the query that answers "is this service isolated?".
--
-- THE COLUMN IS THE DEFINITION OF ACCOUNT-SCOPED, and it is a definition rather
-- than a list because a list is a thing to remember. A table that grows an
-- `account_id` column and no policies appears here on the next run, which is the
-- moment before it matters.
--
-- THE SCOPE IS THE SCHEMAS THE SUBSTRATE WAS APPLIED IN, and that is the whole
-- difference between this function and a scan of every table in the database.
-- The property being asserted is "every account-scoped table THE SERVICE
-- INSTALLED is protected", and its input is the set of tables the substrate was
-- applied to — a whole-database scan is one way to compute that set, and it is
-- the way that breaks every adopter.
--
-- MEASURED, on identity: its test helper builds a private fixture schema per
-- test by cloning tables with `LIKE … INCLUDING ALL`, and `LIKE` does not copy
-- row-level security. Each fixture therefore carries an `account_id` column and
-- no policies. A whole-database sweep named every one of them, so a correct
-- database produced a red proof — and the count moved with how many neighbouring
-- tests were mid-flight (5 on one run, 21 on the next), which is what says it
-- was a reach rather than a defect. A sweep that cannot stay green on a correct
-- database is a sweep nobody reads, and one that goes red for somebody else's
-- fixtures is a sweep an adopter has to work around, which is worse.
--
-- THE SCOPE IS DERIVED, NOT RECORDED, and the difference is the reason an
-- adopter needs no migration to get the fix. There is no registry table, because
-- a registry would have to be created by the NEW substrate and every database
-- that has applied the OLD one does not have it — so the fix would only arrive
-- with a migration, and the proofs it is meant to repair are the thing that
-- decides whether the migration is needed. Instead the scope is read back out of
-- what the substrate ALREADY wrote: `protect_table` names its policies
-- `<table>_cafaye_<command>` and creates an index beside them, so every schema
-- the substrate was applied in is discoverable from the catalog, with nothing
-- new to install and nothing to remember to update.
--
-- Extension-owned tables are excluded (`pg_depend.deptype = 'e'`): pgvector,
-- PostGIS and friends ship their own tables with their own grants, and reporting
-- a table this substrate cannot protect would train the reader to ignore the
-- sweep.
--
-- TEMPORARY TABLES ARE NOT EXCLUDED, and that is deliberate. A temp table with an
-- `account_id` column and no policies is genuinely unprotected, it is exactly
-- the shape a service's test fixture has, and `isolation.sql` plants one on
-- purpose as its sweep's control. It is safe to INCLUDE this file's own session's
-- temporary schema for the reason a fixture schema is not: temporary objects are
-- per-session, so no other session — not another test, not another service — can
-- put a table in scope by creating one. `pg_temp` is the alias; the real schema
-- is named `pg_temp_N`, which is why this is a prefix test and not an equality.

-- A login role that OWNS an account-scoped table can switch that table's
-- policies off, and no amount of FORCE stops it: FORCE is about the owner being
-- SUBJECT to policies, not about the owner being unable to REMOVE them. So the
-- second half of the design is a role that owns nothing, and that claim has
-- nothing to sweep — it is a fact about one role and one table, so it is asserted
-- about the role the application actually logs in as rather than generalised into
-- a query that would have to guess which role that is. `isolation.sql` asserts
-- it three ways, and the two that matter are the ones no catalog reports: the
-- login role is refused `ALTER TABLE ... DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`, and it is
-- refused `DROP POLICY`.
--
-- WHAT THIS FILE DOES NOT PROVE, because every item below is a way the boundary
-- can be right in the database and absent from the service.
--
--   * That the service SETS the identity. `begin_account/1` is one call in one
--     place, and nothing here can tell a service that never calls it from one
--     that calls it in every request. A service that forgets reads zero rows,
--     which is safe and extremely visible, so this is a diagnosis rather than a
--     leak.
--
--   * That the service's QUERIES still carry their own `where account_id = ?`.
--     They should. RLS is defence in depth, not a licence to delete the
--     predicate: the predicate is what makes the query indexable, and it is what
--     a mistake in the policy expression gets caught by. core's
--     `schemas/tenant-isolation.schema.json` still requires the predicate and this
--     file does not change that.
--
--   * That the login role is not a MEMBER of the owner role. The cluster grants
--     `<service>_app` TO `<service>` so a migration and `tests/isolation_test.sh`
--     can impersonate the weaker role; the reverse membership would undo the
--     entire design and is worth asserting in the services that adopt this.
--
--   * That a TABLE is account-scoped. The sweep defines that as "has an
--     `account_id` column", which is the fleet's own vocabulary (D7), and it
--     misses a service that spells it `tenant_id` and protects it by hand. A
--     service with no account-scoped tables at all is the honest zero, and
--     core's `tenancy.honest-zero` finding is what says so out loud.
--
--   * That a SCHEMA the substrate was never applied to holds no account-scoped
--     table. The sweep's scope is the schemas it protected, plus its own and
--     `pg_temp`, so customer rows kept in a schema no `protect_table` call ever
--     named are outside it. That is the trade, and it is a deliberate one: the
--     alternative reports every other session's test fixture, which is how a
--     correct database ends up with a red proof and how an adopter ends up
--     carrying a workaround for a bug that was upstream. A service whose account
--     tables span schemas the substrate has not met is a service that has not
--     protected them, and `protect_table` is one call per table.
